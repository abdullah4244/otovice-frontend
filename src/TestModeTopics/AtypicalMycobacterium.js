      question: "What is your differential diagnosis for a child with lateral neck swelling?",
      sample_answer: "My differential diagnosis for lateral neck swelling in a child categorizes into congenital, infectious, benign neoplasia, and malignant neoplasia. Specifically: Congenital: Branchial cleft anomaly Infection: Non-tuberculous mycobacteria, other causes like EBV, CMV, Kawasaki disease, cat scratch disease Benign neoplasia: Schwannoma, salivary gland tumors (pleomorphic adenoma), thyroid neoplasms Malignant neoplasia: Lymphoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, thyroid neoplasms, metastatic neck secondary.",
    },
    {
      question: "What would you inquire about during your history taking for this patient?",
      sample_answer: "During history taking, I would categorize my inquiries as follows: Onset and duration of neck swelling: To differentiate between acute (suggestive of infections) and chronic conditions (suggestive of malignancies or congenital anomalies). Location and size of the swelling: Helps in localizing the swelling to specific anatomical neck regions which can hint towards specific etiologies. Pain and overlying skin changes: Pain may indicate an infectious process or inflammation, while skin changes could suggest a chronic condition or underlying infection like non-tuberculous mycobacterium with violaceous hue of the skin. Preceding upper respiratory tract infections or dental issues: To assess if the lymphadenopathy is reactive in nature. Systemic symptoms: Like fever, weight loss, night sweats which could indicate a malignant process or systemic infection. History of foreign travel and contact with pets: To evaluate for zoonotic infections or exposure to endemic diseases. Previous history of malignancy or immunocompromised state: To assess the risk of metastatic disease or opportunistic infections.",
    },
    {
      question: "What would you look for during your examination of this patient?",
      sample_answer: "During the examination, my focus would include: Inspection of the neck lump: Noting the size, location, and any overlying skin changes. Violaceous hue or thinning of the skin could suggest non-tuberculous mycobacterial infection. Palpation of the lump: To assess for tenderness, consistency (firm, soft, fluctuant), and mobility. Firm, non-tender lumps are more concerning for malignancies or benign tumors. Oropharyngeal examination: To check for tonsil size, asymmetry, or any signs of current infection that could explain reactive lymphadenopathy. Examination for additional lumps: To determine if there are more affected nodes, suggesting a systemic process. Systemic examination for signs of hepatosplenomegaly: Which could indicate a systemic disease like lymphoma.",
    },
    {
      question: "How would you investigate this patient?",
      sample_answer: "I would request: Laboratory Investigations: Complete Blood Count (CBC), Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR), and C-reactive protein (CRP) to assess for inflammation or signs of malignancy. Serology for EBV, CMV, Toxoplasma, Bartonella to identify specific infections. Interferon-gamma release assays (IGRA) and tuberculin skin test (TST) if tuberculosis or NTM is suspected. Imaging: Ultrasound of the neck to evaluate the size, structure, and characteristics of the lymph nodes and to guide biopsy if needed. Chest X-ray to look for mediastinal widening or signs of primary tuberculosis. CT/MRI if malignancy is suspected or to evaluate complex anatomy before surgical intervention. Microbiological and Histopathological: Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA) or excisional biopsy of the lymph node for cytology, culture (including mycobacteria), and histopathology to identify specific pathogens or malignancy.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is the benefit of performing an ultrasound in these patients?",
      sample_answer: "The ultrasound helps in assessing the size, structure, and internal architecture of the lymph nodes, identifying abnormal nodes (e.g., loss of fatty hilum, round shape), and guiding fine-needle aspiration or biopsy. It's non-invasive, provides real-time imaging, and helps in differentiating between cystic and solid masses, and between benign and malignant processes.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is the advantage of an excision biopsy over fine needle aspiration cytology (FNA-c)?",
      sample_answer: "The advantage of an excision biopsy over fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) includes: Providing a larger tissue sample that allows for a more comprehensive histopathological evaluation, increasing the diagnostic accuracy, especially for diseases that require architectural context such as lymphomas. The ability to perform additional testing on the tissue, such as special stains and molecular tests, which can be critical for diagnosing specific types of infections or malignancies. Potentially being therapeutic as well as diagnostic in cases where removing the lymph node or mass can resolve the condition or prevent complications.",
    },
    {
      question: "What would you expect on history and examination if it was a case of atypical mycobacterium?",
      sample_answer: "In the case of atypical mycobacterium, on history, I would expect: Subacute or chronic presentation with a slowly enlarging neck lump without significant systemic symptoms, potentially with exposure to water sources or soil. Possibly a history of minor trauma or break in the skin near the site of the lymphadenopathy. No significant response to conventional antibiotics. On examination: A non-tender, firm lump with overlying skin changes such as a violaceous hue or thinning of the skin over the lump. Possible development of a sinus tract with chronic drainage if the infection is advanced. Absence of significant systemic signs such as fever or weight loss.",
    },
    {
      question: "What are the types of atypical mycobacterium?",
      sample_answer: "Types of atypical mycobacterium (non-tuberculous mycobacteria, NTM) include: Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), which is most commonly associated with lymphadenopathy in children. Mycobacterium kansasii, Mycobacterium marinum, and Mycobacterium haemophilum, which are less commonly involved but can cause lymphadenopathy and other clinical manifestations. Rapidly growing mycobacteria such as Mycobacterium abscessus, Mycobacterium chelonae, and Mycobacterium fortuitum, which are more often associated with skin and soft tissue infections but can also cause lymphadenopathy.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do you diagnose atypical mycobacterial lymphadenitis?",
      sample_answer: "The IPOG group divides diagnosis into definite and probable lymphadenitis. Definite atypical mycobacterial lymphadenitis requires a combination of typical symptoms with isolation of atypical mycobacterial specials from either lymph note tissue or aspirate via culture or PCR. Probably atypical mycobacterial lymphadenitis is diagnose based on clinical and radiological findings that are highly suggestive but without treatment.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is the role of FNA?",
      sample_answer: "Fine needle aspiration (FNA) serves multiple purposes: Diagnostic Sampling: FNA can provide material for culture and PCR testing, crucial for confirming the presence of NTM and identifying the species involved. Therapeutic Intervention: In some cases, aspiration of an abscessed lymph node can offer symptomatic relief. FNA is a minimally invasive procedure that carries a lower risk of complications compared to surgical biopsy. However, it may not always provide sufficient material for definitive diagnosis, and there is a small risk of fistula formation after aspiration. While FNA is valuable, it's important to consider its limitations. A negative FNA result does not rule out NTM lymphadenitis, especially if only a small sample was obtained or if the NTM species present grows poorly in culture. In such cases, further diagnostic steps, including excisional biopsy for culture and histological examination, may be necessary to obtain a definitive diagnosis.",

    {
      question: "How would you manage this patient?",
      sample_answer: "Management is controversial and requires an MDT approach with our paediatric and infectious disease colleagues. It is important to counsel the patients' parents about the natural history of the disease and that it may take 6 to 12 months to resolve. In our centre we tend to treat actively with oral antibiotics rather than manage even the small ones conservatively. We use clarithromycin with rifampicin, but I am aware there other macrolides with or without antituberculous medications or fluroquinolones may be used. The treatment duration can vary but often extends for several months to ensure complete resolution. We preserve surgical excision of the affected nodes for cases where there is significant disease burden, cosmetic concerns or failure of prolonged treatment. Complete excision is diagnostic and therapeutic but we approach it with caution considering the risk of scaring and damage to the facial nerve. In cases where complete excision is not feasible due to the risk of complications or based on the location of the infection, other surgical options like incision and drainage or debulking may be considered, although these carry a higher risk of recurrence or chronic infection.",

    {
      question: "What is the prognosis of the condition?",
      sample_answer: "The prognosis for pediatric cervical lymphadenopathy due to atypical mycobacterium with treatment is generally good, with most patients achieving complete resolution of infection and symptoms. The success rate is particularly high with complete surgical excision, reported at 98% in a 2015 meta analysis, compared to 73% with anti-mycobacterial antibiotics and 70% with observation.",
