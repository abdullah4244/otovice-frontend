    {
      question: "Please describe this audiogram",
      sample_answer: "This is an audiogram showing a mild to moderate conductive hearing loss of the left ear. Of note, the lower frequency masked bone conduction thresholds are better than 0, which would make me suspicious of a condition such as superior semicircular canal dehiscence syndrome.",
    },
    {
      question: "What would be your differential diagnosis for a low frequency conductive hearing loss in general?",
      sample_answer: "My differential diagnosis includes: Ossicular diseases, such as otosclerosis. Mucosal disease, such as cholesteatoma. Tumors, such as jugulotympanic paraganglioma. and Temporal bone disease, such as superior semicircular canal dehiscence syndrome.",
    },
    {
      question: "If you suspected superior semicircular canal dehiscence syndrome, What would you ask during your history for this patient?",
      sample_answer: "I would ask about onset, duration and progression of the hearing loss, as well as associated symptoms such as pulsatile tinnitus, aural fullness and vertigo. I would enquire about specific symptoms such as vertigo to loud noises (known as Tullio phenomenon), dizziness or vertigo upon changes in pressure (such as sneezing, coughing or straining), and autophony, where the patient hears their own voice, heartbeat, or even eye movements and footsteps loudly in their head. I would also explore for potential causative factors, asking about history of trauma, middle fossa surgery, or raised intracranial pressure.",
    },
    {
      question: "What would you look for during your examination of this patient?",
      sample_answer: "I would perform Otoscopy, Expecting it to be normal. I would also perform a number of tests including the Fistula test, A positive result being where applying pressure to the external auditory canal induces dizziness or nystagmus. A Valsalva maneuver could indicate SSCD through eliciting vertigo or autophony. Rinne & Weber’s tests might indicate conductive hearing loss on the affected side, and a low-frequency tuning fork placed on the ankle might be heard in the affected ear.",
    },
    {
      question: "What investigations would you undertake for this patient?",
      sample_answer: "As well as low-frequency conductive hearing loss and super-normal bone conduction thresholds, I would request Vestibular Evoked Myogenic Potentials Looking for a reduced threshold and increased amplitude on the affected side. High-Resolution CT of the temporal bones with reconstructions in Pöschl's and Stenvers' planes would allow me to directly visualize the dehiscence. Electrocochleography may show an elevated SP/AP ratio.",
    },
    {
      question: "Please describe the findings of their CT Scan.",
      sample_answer: "This is a coronal CT scan of the temporal bone showing dehiscence of the superior semicircular canal and tegmen. In the context of this patient, this is indicative of a diagnosis of superior semicircular canal dehiscence syndrome.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is Superior Semicircular Canal Dehiscence Syndrome?",
      sample_answer: "Superior Semicircular Canal Dehiscence Syndrome is a condition characterized by a reduction or absence of bone overlying the superior semicircular canal. This leads to a third mobile window in addition to the oval and round windows of the inner ear, which causes abnormal responsiveness of the ear to sound and pressure changes. The condition can be congenital or acquired through trauma, surgery, or increased CSF pressure.",
    },
    {
      question: "What treatment options are available for this patient?",
      sample_answer: "I would begin with Conservative management, which would involve Vestibular rehabilitation, tinnitus retraining therapy, and avoidance of triggering sounds or activities. Medical treatment comprises of Short-term use of vestibular sedatives for symptomatic relief of vertigo. Surgical interventions include Plugging or resurfacing the superior semicircular canal through either a middle cranial fossa or trans-mastoid approach to eliminate the third window effect.",
    },
    {
      question: "Discuss the surgical approaches for the management of superior semicircular canal dehiscence",
      sample_answer: "Surgery is generally used in patients with severe symptoms despite conservative management. It can be approached via a transmastoid approach or middle fossa craniotomy. The option of plugging involves using fascia and bone wax or bone pate to close the canal lumen. The tegmen can be resurfaced with cartilage and bone cement.",
    },
    {
      question: "What are the outcomes of surgery?",
      sample_answer: "Surgical outcomes for SSCD are generally positive, with most patients experiencing significant improvement in vertigo, autophony, and pulsatile tinnitus. However, hearing results are variable, and a proportion of patients may experience mild sensorineural hearing loss post-operatively. Equilibrium and balance are typically significantly improved by 4 to 6 weeks post-surgery, although immediate postoperative disequilibrium can be a challenge. The risk of serious complications such as intracranial bleeding or temporal lobe injury is low, less than 1%.",
