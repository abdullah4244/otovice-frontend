      question: "A patient is referred to you with throat pain and an enlarged tonsil. What would you inquire about during your history taking for this patient?",
      sample_answer: "My inquiry would encompass: Symptoms: Specifically, any presence of dysphagia, odynophagia, changes in voice including a 'hot potato' voice, unexplained weight loss, persistent sore throat, or ear pain due to referred otalgia. These symptoms could suggest oropharyngeal malignancy. The duration and progression of these symptoms would also be crucial for understanding the potential malignancy's aggressiveness. Risk Factors: I would assess lifestyle and environmental risk factors, such as tobacco and alcohol use, as both are significant contributors to oropharyngeal cancer. For HPV-related cancers, discussions around sexual history, including number of partners and practices, might be relevant due to HPV's transmission routes. Medical History: Any past incidence of cancers, especially head and neck cancers, and treatments received. Additionally, any history of immunocompromised states, including HIV, could be pertinent as they might elevate the risk for HPV-associated oropharyngeal cancers. Family History: Inquiry about any family history of cancer could indicate a genetic predisposition to malignancies. Social and Occupational History: Exposure to potential carcinogens at work and the patient's social support system could influence both risk and treatment options.",

      question: "What would you look for during your examination of this patient?",
      sample_answer: "My examination would include: Oral and Oropharyngeal Examination: Inspecting the oral cavity for any lesions, asymmetry, or enlargement of the tonsils, noting any masses or ulcerations. A thorough examination of the oropharynx, including the base of the tongue, soft palate, and tonsillar areas, is crucial for assessing the primary site of the tumor. Neck Examination: Palpating the neck to identify any cervical lymphadenopathy, which could indicate metastatic spread of the disease. The size, consistency, and mobility of any lymph nodes would be carefully noted. Cranial Nerve Assessment: Evaluating the function of cranial nerves, especially those that could be affected by tumor spread, including the glossopharyngeal and hypoglossal nerves, to assess for any neuropathy indicating deeper invasion. Nasopharyngoscopy: If available, performing a nasopharyngoscopy would allow direct visualization of the nasopharynx, oropharynx, and hypopharynx to identify lesions not visible in a standard oral examination.",

    {
      question: "What investigations would you undertake for this patient?",
      sample_answer: "For a patient presenting with symptoms suggestive of oropharyngeal cancer, the following investigations would be crucial to confirm the diagnosis, stage the disease, and guide treatment: Imaging Studies: MRI of the head and neck with contrast is preferred to delineate the primary tumor, evaluate soft tissue contrast, and assess for any invasion into adjacent structures or early bone marrow involvement. A CT scan of the chest would be performed for systemic staging to identify any distant metastases. Ultrasound of the Neck with Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA) or Core Biopsy: This would be used to evaluate any cervical lymphadenopathy detected during the physical examination. Ultrasound guidance increases the accuracy of the biopsy. Panendoscopy and Biopsy under General Anesthesia: To visually inspect the oropharynx, larynx, and esophagus, and perform a directed biopsy of the primary site and any suspicious areas. This comprehensive evaluation helps confirm the diagnosis and assess the extent of the disease. If there are no suspicious areas, I would perform tonsillectomy. I also assess and record access, fixity, palatal extent, laterality of the lesion to aid in deciding about appropriateness for transoral surgery. The samples would be sent for p16 immunohistochemistry. Comprehensive Blood Work: Including complete blood count, liver function tests, and renal function tests, to assess the patient's overall health status and suitability for various treatments. PET-CT would be reserved for N3 disease to assist in staging and to assess response to treatment.",

      question: "Tell me about HPV and its role in oropharyngeal cancer.",
      sample_answer: "HPV is a DNA virus that infects epithelial cells, and its high-risk subtypes, especially HPV-16 and 18, are associated with oropharyngeal cancers. The virus's oncogenic proteins, E6 and E7, interfere with tumor suppressor proteins p53 and Rb, respectively, leading to uncontrolled cell growth and cancer development. HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancers are distinct from HPV-negative ones in their epidemiology, risk factors, clinical presentation, and prognosis. Patients with HPV-positive cancers tend to be younger, have fewer traditional risk factors such as tobacco and alcohol use, and have a better response to treatment. As such, HPV status significantly influences the staging, management, and prognostication of oropharyngeal cancers, with HPV-positive cancers generally having a more favorable prognosis.",
    },
    {
      question: "Tell me about P16 positivity.",
      sample_answer: "P16 overexpression is a surrogate marker for HPV infection in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). P16 is a tumor suppressor protein, and its overexpression is indicative of HPV-driven carcinogenesis, particularly due to the inactivation of the Rb protein by the HPV E7 oncogene. Immunohistochemistry showing strong and diffuse nuclear and cytoplasmic staining in more than 70% of tumor cells is used to determine p16 positivity. This marker has both diagnostic and prognostic value, as p16-positive oropharyngeal cancers, which are typically HPV-driven, are associated with a better prognosis and response to treatment compared to p16-negative, HPV-negative cancers.",
    },
    {
      question: "Describe the T staging of oropharyngeal cancer.",
      sample_answer: "It is as follows: TX: Primary tumor cannot be assessed. Tis: Carcinoma in situ. T1: Tumor 2 cm or less in greatest dimension. T2: Tumor more than 2 cm but not more than 4 cm in greatest dimension. T3: Tumor more than 4 cm in greatest dimension or with extension to the lingual surface of the epiglottis. T4 (Varies by HPV status): For HPV-positive cancers, T4 includes tumor invasion into adjacent structures such as deep muscle of tongue, hard palate, or the mandible. HPV negative tumours have T4a and T4b, reflecting extension to the larynx or skull base, respectively.",
    },
    {
      question: "Describe the N staging of HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer.",
      sample_answer: "The N staging for HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer reflects the lymph node involvement and has been tailored to account for the distinct behavior of HPV-positive cancers, which often present with more extensive nodal disease but have a better prognosis: NX: Regional lymph nodes cannot be assessed. N0: No regional lymph node metastasis. N1: Single ipsilateral lymph node metastasis, 6 cm or smaller in greatest dimension. N2: Metastasis in bilateral or contralateral lymph nodes, all 6 cm or smaller. N3: Metastasis in a lymph node larger than 6 cm in greatest dimension.",

    {
      question: "What are the management options for a patient with oropharyngeal cancer, and when do you use them?",
      sample_answer: "Management options for oropharyngeal cancer vary widely based on the stage of the disease, HPV status, and patient factors such as overall health and treatment preferences. The mainstays of treatment include: Surgery: Transoral robotic surgery (TORS) or transoral laser microsurgery (TLM) are minimally invasive options for early-stage tumors, allowing for precise tumor removal with less morbidity. Surgery is often followed by adjuvant therapy (radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy) based on pathological findings such as margins and lymph node involvement. Radiotherapy (RT): Alone or combined with chemotherapy (CRT), RT is a cornerstone for both early and advanced stages. Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is preferred for its ability to minimize damage to surrounding tissues. Chemotherapy: Used in conjunction with RT for advanced stages or as palliative treatment. Platinum-based chemotherapy is commonly used. Human Papillomavirus (HPV) status: Influences treatment decisions, especially in the context of clinical trials exploring treatment de-escalation for HPV-positive patients to reduce long-term side effects without compromising outcomes. The choice between these treatments is influenced by the goal of preserving function (e.g., speech and swallowing), minimizing morbidity, and providing the best chance for cure or control of the disease.",

      question: "How would you manage a patient with T2N1 HPV-positive disease?",
      sample_answer: "For a T2N1 HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer patient, considering the favorable prognosis associated with HPV positivity, the treatment plan would aim to balance effective cancer control with the preservation of quality of life. Options include: Transoral Surgery (TORS or TLM) followed by adjuvant radiotherapy, depending on pathological features such as close margins or lymphovascular invasion. The lesser extent of surgery compared to traditional open approaches helps preserve function. Primary Radiotherapy on its own is also an option.",
    },
    {
      question: "How would you manage a patient with T4 N2C HPV-negative disease?",
      sample_answer: "For a patient with T4 N2C HPV-negative oropharyngeal cancer, an aggressive treatment approach is warranted due to the advanced stage and poorer prognosis associated with HPV-negative status: Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy is the standard of care, utilizing high-dose radiation combined with platinum-based chemotherapy to target both the primary tumor and nodal disease aggressively. Surgical Resection may be considered in selected cases where the tumor is resectable, followed by adjuvant chemoradiotherapy, especially if there are adverse pathological features such as positive margins or extranodal extension, however we try to avoid triple modality treatment.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do you manage the neck in oropharyngeal cancer?",
      sample_answer: "Management of the neck in oropharyngeal cancer involves a strategic approach based on the stage of the disease and the primary treatment modality: Surgical Management: In early-stage disease or when surgery is the primary treatment for the tumor, a selective neck dissection targeting levels II-IV (and possibly level V, depending on the tumor location) is performed to address potential microscopic disease. The extent of neck dissection may be modified based on the tumor's HPV status, given the different patterns of metastasis. Radiation Therapy: In cases where primary treatment involves radiation, the neck is treated with radiation fields designed to encompass at-risk lymph node levels. The intensity and extent of radiation can vary based on the nodal stage and the presence of extranodal extension. Post-Treatment Surveillance: After treatment, imaging with ultrasound or PET-CT may be used to monitor the neck for any signs of recurrence. Management decisions for residual disease after initial treatment are guided by multidisciplinary discussion, with considerations for salvage surgery or additional radiation, depending on prior treatments and patient factors.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do you follow up a patient post-treatment?",
      sample_answer: "The follow-up regimen typically involves: Regular Clinical Examinations: Including physical examination of the head and neck area, assessment of the oropharynx, and palpation of the neck for lymphadenopathy. The frequency of visits decreases over time but is typically more frequent in the first two years post-treatment, starting at 6 to 8 weekly, then 3 to 4 monthly, before coming down to 6 monthly for the last year of 5. Imaging: PET-CT scans are often used around 12 weeks post-treatment to evaluate the response to therapy. Subsequent imaging may be tailored based on symptoms, physical findings, or if recurrence is suspected. Functional Assessment and Rehabilitation: Evaluation of speech, swallowing, and nutritional status, with referrals to speech and language therapists, dietitians, or other rehabilitation services as needed. Psychosocial Support: Ongoing support to address the psychological and emotional impact of cancer diagnosis, treatment, and recovery.",
    },
    {
      question: "What factors affect your choice of surgery vs radiotherapy in early tumors?",
      sample_answer: "The choice between surgery and radiotherapy for early-stage oropharyngeal cancer involves consideration of several factors: Tumor Location and Size: Tumors that are easily accessible and resectable with minimal functional impact may be more suitable for surgical approaches, while radiotherapy might be preferred for tumors in more challenging locations or larger tumors where surgery could significantly affect function. HPV Status: HPV-positive tumors have a better prognosis and may respond well to either modality. Clinical trials are exploring whether treatment can be de-escalated for these patients. Patient Factors: Including overall health, comorbidities, patient preferences, and the potential impact of treatment on quality of life. For example, patients may prefer surgery if it potentially reduces the need for chemotherapy or extensive radiation. Functional Preservation: The potential impact of each treatment modality on speech, swallowing, and other critical functions is a key consideration. Surgical techniques like TORS aim to preserve these functions, as does carefully planned IMRT.",

    {
      question: "Tell me about margins in oropharyngeal cancer.",
      sample_answer: "The definition of a 'clear' margin can vary, but generally, a margin of 5 mm is considered adequate. For HPV-positive cancers, smaller margins may still be considered acceptable due to the better overall prognosis and response to treatment. The status of surgical margins significantly influences post-operative management, with positive margins (cancer cells present at the resection edge) often necessitating adjuvant radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy to address residual disease risk.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is the role of PET?",
      sample_answer: "Positron Emission Tomography (PET), especially when combined with computed tomography (PET-CT), plays a crucial role in the management of oropharyngeal cancer at various stages: Pre-treatment Staging: PET-CT can help identify distant metastases and assess the extent of the disease, which is critical for staging and treatment planning. Response Assessment: Post-treatment PET-CT scans are used to evaluate the response to treatment, particularly for advanced disease treated with chemoradiotherapy. A scan typically performed 12 weeks after completion of treatment can help distinguish between residual disease and post-treatment changes. Surveillance: PET-CT may also be used during follow-up to detect recurrence, particularly in symptomatic patients or when physical examination and conventional imaging are inconclusive.",
    },
    {
      question: "Tell me about ongoing research trials in this field.",
      sample_answer: "Ongoing trials include: PATHOS: This trial is investigating the possibility of reducing the intensity of adjuvant radiotherapy for patients with HPV-positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma who have undergone transoral surgery. The goal is to maintain high cure rates while reducing the long-term side effects associated with radiotherapy. ECOG-ACRIN E3311: A phase II trial exploring the outcomes of transoral resection followed by low-dose or standard-dose radiation therapy with or without chemotherapy for HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer. This trial aims to tailor post-surgical treatment intensity based on pathological risk factors. ORATOR: A trial comparing quality of life outcomes between patients with HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer treated with transoral surgery followed by adjuvant therapy as needed and those treated with definitive chemoradiation. This study aims to provide evidence on the functional outcomes associated with each treatment approach. Pembrolizumab Trials: Several trials are investigating the use of pembrolizumab, an immunotherapy drug, in combination with chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy for advanced or recurrent oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma. These studies are part of a broader effort to integrate immunotherapy into first-line treatment regimens. TORPEdO: A trial comparing proton therapy to standard intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) in patients with oropharyngeal cancers. The aim is to assess whether proton therapy offers advantages in reducing treatment-related side effects, particularly for swallowing and quality of life. CheckMate 651: A trial investigating the effectiveness of nivolumab plus ipilimumab versus standard-of-care EXTREME regimen (cetuximab plus chemotherapy) in patients with recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, including the oropharynx. This trial is part of ongoing efforts to explore the potential of combination immunotherapy in this patient population.",
