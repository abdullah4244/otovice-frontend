      question: "You are asked to see a 2 year old in clinic who has been referred for multiple episodes of stridor treated as croup. What is your differential diagnosis for this presentation?",
      sample_answer: "The differential diagnosis for a 2-year-old presenting with multiple episodes of stridor, initially treated as croup, includes various infectious and non-infectious causes. Infectious causes can be viral, such as croup (acute laryngotracheobronchitis) primarily caused by parainfluenza virus, or bacterial, like bacterial tracheitis and acute epiglottitis. Non-infectious causes encompass anatomical abnormalities such as laryngeal web, congenital subglottic stenosis, and vocal cord paralysis; benign laryngeal neoplasms like recurrent respiratory papillomatosis; and external compressions like vascular rings and pulmonary artery sling. Other considerations include foreign body aspiration and conditions like tracheomalacia.",
    },
    {
      question: "What would you inquire about during history taking for this patient?",
      sample_answer: "During history taking, I would ask about: Onset and progression of the stridor to understand if it is acute or gradual, indicating the nature of the condition. Presence of any associated prodrome, such as a viral upper respiratory infection which may suggest infectious causes like croup or bacterial tracheitis. Associated Symptoms such as Cough, fever, difficulty swallowing, drooling, voice changes, breathing difficulties during sleep or feeding. Feeding difficulties or weight gain, as severe airway obstruction might affect the child's ability to feed properly. Previous intubations or surgeries indicating potential acquired causes of stridor like subglottic stenosis. Family history of similar issues or genetic conditions. Vaccination history, specifically for Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), as unvaccinated children are at higher risk for certain infections like epiglottitis. Environmental Factors such as Possible exposure to foreign bodies, recent sick contacts.",
    },
    {
      question: "What would you look for during your examination of this patient?",
      sample_answer: "During examination, I would: Assess the respiratory effort, looking for signs of distress such as nasal flaring, tracheal tug, and use of accessory muscles. Evaluate the voice and cry for hoarseness or aphonia which might suggest vocal cord involvement. Observe for any anatomical abnormalities in the neck or face that could indicate congenital issues, for example a haemangioma in the beard distribution. Listen to the character and timing of the stridor (inspiratory, expiratory, or biphasic) to help localize the level of airway obstruction. Oropharyngeal Examination looking for Signs of infection, foreign bodies, structural anomalies. Neck Examination looking for Palpable masses, positioning e.g. torticolis. Check for cyanosis or pallor indicating severe hypoxia. These findings assist in localizing the lesion and understanding its severity.",
    },
    {
      question: "What initial investigations would you undertake for this patient?",
      sample_answer: "For initial investigations, I would: Order radiographic imaging, such as a lateral neck X-ray to look for the steeple sign associated with croup or the thumbprint sign of epiglottitis. A chest X-ray can help assess for foreign bodies or other lower airway issues. Flexible laryngoscopy for direct visualization of the airway to identify structural abnormalities, foreign bodies, or dynamic airway issues such as laryngomalacia. Pulmonary function tests if the child can cooperate, to assess the impact of the stridor on ventilation. Blood tests to identify signs of infection or inflammation if an infectious cause is suspected. I would also consider MLB to look for conditions such as subglottic stenosis and laryngeal cleft.",

      question: "What are the causes of pediatric subglottic stenosis?",
      sample_answer: "Causes of pediatric subglottic stenosis include: Congenital: Abnormal development leading to a narrowed airway at the cricoid cartilage. Acquired: Resulting from prolonged intubation, trauma to the airway, infection, or inhalation injury.",
    },
    {
      question: "How is subglottic stenosis graded?",
      sample_answer: "Subglottic stenosis is graded using the Myer-Cotton grading system based on the percentage of airway obstruction: Grade I: 050% narrowing Grade II: 5170% narrowing Grade III: 7199% narrowing Grade IV: No detectable lumen.",
    },
    {
      question: "What are the treatment options for subglottic stenosis?",
      sample_answer: "Treatment options depend on the grade of stenosis. For mild cases (Grade I-II), conservative management or endoscopic procedures like balloon dilation might be sufficient. Severe cases (Grade III-IV) often require more invasive surgical interventions such as open laryngotracheal reconstruction with grafting or cricotracheal resection and anastomosis. Tracheostomy may also be required to manage the airway. Medical management for associated conditions like gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is also important.",
    },
    {
      question: "Tell me about the surgical options",
      sample_answer: "Surgical options for subglottic stenosis include: Endoscopic approaches, such as balloon dilation, laser ablation, or the application of mitomycin-C to reduce scarring. These are less invasive and may be appropriate for milder cases or as part of a multi-modality approach. Laryngotracheal reconstruction (LTR) involves expanding the narrowed segment with cartilage grafts placed either anteriorly, posteriorly, or both. It can be performed as a single-stage (patient is extubated post-operatively) or a double-stage (with a temporary tracheostomy) procedure. Cricotracheal resection and anastomosis involve removing the stenotic segment and reconnecting the healthy ends of the airway. This is generally reserved for severe, short-segment stenosis. Slide tracheoplasty is used for long-segment tracheal stenosis, where the trachea is cut longitudinally and then reattached in a manner that widens its diameter. These options are tailored based on the severity of stenosis, length of the affected segment, and the presence of comorbid conditions.",
