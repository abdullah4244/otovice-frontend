      question: "What is your differential diagnosis for a 55-year-old patient presenting with a right-sided neck swelling?",
      sample_answer: "My differentials would be either malignant or benign. Malignant Causes include: Metastatic Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC): Commonly from an oropharyngeal primary, especially HPV-related given the rise in HPV-associated oropharyngeal cancer. Also consider non-HPV related SCC from other regions like laryngeal or hypopharyngeal sites. Lymphoma: Both Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma can present as cervical lymphadenopathy. Other Head and Neck Malignancies: These include thyroid cancer, cutaneous malignancies that have metastasized, and malignancies from salivary glands. Benign Causes: Reactive Lymphadenopathy: Commonly due to infections or inflammatory processes. Branchial Cleft Cyst: Congenital lesions that can present later in life as a neck swelling. Lipoma: Benign tumors of fatty tissue that can occur anywhere in the body, including the neck.",
    },
    {
      question: "What would you inquire about during your history taking for this patient?",
      sample_answer: "In my history taking, I would systematically explore several areas: Symptoms Related to the Lump: I would ask about pain, any recent growth or changes, and if the swelling fluctuates in size, which might suggest a benign cyst or inflammation. Associated Symptoms: Questions about dysphagia, odynophagia, voice changes, or breathing difficulties could suggest involvement of deeper structures or a malignancy. Systemic Symptoms: Queries about weight loss, night sweats, or fevers could indicate a systemic disease like lymphoma or metastatic cancer. Risk Factors: I would gather information on smoking and alcohol use, exposure to radiation, or occupational hazards, which are risk factors for various head and neck cancers. Past Medical and Surgical History: Including any previous cancers, particularly head and neck cancers, or treatments that could predispose to secondary malignancies or recurrence. Family History: To check for any genetic predisposition to cancers or other relevant diseases.",
    },
    {
      question: "What would you look for during your examination of this patient?",
      sample_answer: "During the physical examination, I would focus on: Inspection and Palpation of the Neck: Assess the lump for size, texture, mobility, and whether it is tender, which can help differentiate between inflammatory and neoplastic causes. Comprehensive Head and Neck Examination: This includes inspection of the oral cavity, oropharynx, and nasopharynx using tools like a nasolaryngoscope to detect any mucosal lesions that might be the primary site of a neoplasm. Systemic Examination: Looking for signs of systemic illness, such as cachexia or lymphadenopathy in other regions that might suggest a more widespread disease process. Ear Examination: Particularly if there's a concern for nasopharyngeal carcinoma, which can present with serous otitis media.",
    },
    {
      question: "What investigations would you undertake for this patient?",
      sample_answer: "Ultrasound with Fine Needle Aspiration or Core Biopsy: To confirm malignancy and determine the nature of the tumor (SCC, lymphoma, etc.). MRI of the Head and Neck: Provides superior soft tissue contrast and is particularly useful in assessing the pharyngeal mucosal space and parapharyngeal structures. PET-CT Scan: To help in detecting the primary site if not identified by MRI and to assess for distant metastases. PET-CT can also assist in staging and treatment planning by showing metabolic activity.",
    },
    {
      question: "What immunohistochemistry tests should be done on the biopsy specimens?",
      sample_answer: "Immunohistochemical tests should include: P16 Staining: To assess for HPV-associated cancer, which has implications for prognosis and treatment. EBER Staining: To detect Epstein-Barr Virus, which is associated with nasopharyngeal carcinoma.",
    },
    {
      question: "When should you discuss this patient in the head and neck MDT?",
      sample_answer: "Once the preliminary investigations including imaging and biopsy are completed, but before finalizing a comprehensive treatment plan. This multidisciplinary discussion ensures all potential diagnostic and therapeutic avenues are considered. The guidelines also suggest early referral to a core member of the head and neck MDT.",
    },
    {
      question: "What do you do if your investigations don't show any primary site but the neck node confirms SCC?",
      sample_answer: "I would discuss the case in the head and neck MDT, and it is likely that If no primary site is found but SCC is confirmed in the neck node, we would proceed with diagnostic surgery, including an ipsilateral tonsillectomy and tongue base mucosectomy, to extensively search for the primary tumor according to the new guidelines. If these are negative, we would consider a contralateral tonsillectomy and further mucosectomy.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is the definition of an SCC of unknown primary?",
      sample_answer: "SCC of unknown primary is defined as the presence of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma in cervical lymph nodes without an identifiable primary tumor despite comprehensive evaluation, including physical examination, imaging, and endoscopic exams.",
    },
    {
      question: "Let's say the ipsilateral tongue base mucosectomy found the tumor. What margins would you consider to be adequately treated?",
      sample_answer: "In cases where the primary tumor is identified through an ipsilateral tongue base mucosectomy, Typically, a margin of at least 5 mm of normal tissue around the tumor is considered adequate for squamous cell carcinoma. If the initial surgery does not achieve clear margins, further intervention may be necessary. This might include additional resection or, adjuvant therapy such as radiation, possibly with chemotherapy, which may be recommended even in completely excised cases based on the overall risk of recurrence, presence of adverse features like lymphovascular invasion, perineural invasion, or deep tissue invasion.",
    },
    {
      question: "Let's say ipsilateral tonsillectomy found the tumor. What would you do next?",
      sample_answer: "The next steps are aimed at ensuring complete cancer control and determining the need for additional treatments: We would Assess the Margins to determine if we have 5mm clearance, and consider further treatment with wider oropharyngectomy if necessary. Based on the pathological findings, such as the tumor stage, nodal involvement, and margin status, adjuvant therapy (radiation with or without chemotherapy) may be indicated. This is particularly important if there are high-risk features such as extracapsular spread in lymph nodes, multiple lymph node involvements, or advanced primary disease. Regular follow-up is necessary to monitor for any signs of recurrence. This includes physical examinations, imaging studies, and the use of PET-CT scans to detect early recurrence or residual disease.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is the role of radiotherapy in SCC of unknown primary?",
      sample_answer: "Adjuvant Treatment: When surgical attempts to locate or resect the primary and affected lymph nodes are made, adjuvant radiotherapy is often used to treat potential residual microscopic disease, thereby reducing the risk of local recurrence. Primary Treatment Modality: In cases where surgery is not feasible, radiotherapy can serve as the primary treatment. It is particularly crucial when the primary tumor site remains unidentified, as it can target broader regions that might harbor the unseen primary. Target Volume Considerations: Radiotherapy may include the ipsilateral neck and potential primary sites such as the oropharynx, based on nodal involvement and other clinical features. In HPV-positive cases, it may focus on the oropharynx, while in HPV-negative cases, it might also cover additional sites based on the nodal spread and other risk factors.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is the role of chemotherapy in SCC of unknown primary?",
      sample_answer: "Enhancing Radiotherapy Efficacy: Chemotherapy is used to potentiate the effects of radiotherapy, particularly in settings where the disease burden is high or where aggressive features like extranodal extension are present. Systemic Disease Control: It helps manage the risk of distant metastases in aggressive cancers, particularly in HPV-negative cases, which are often associated with a poorer prognosis. Specific Indications: Chemotherapy is particularly recommended for patients with extensive nodal involvement (N2-N3 disease) or those who exhibit extranodal spread, as these features indicate a higher risk of systemic spread.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is PET-CT?",
      sample_answer: "PET-CT (Positron Emission Tomography-Computed Tomography) is a hybrid imaging technique that combines the functional imaging capability of PET with the anatomical detail provided by CT. In PET, a radiolabeled tracer, most commonly fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), which is taken up by actively metabolizing cells like cancer cells, is used to visualize metabolic activity. The CT component then provides detailed anatomical localization of these metabolic activities. This combination allows for precise identification of both the presence and the location of active malignancies.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is the role of PET-CT in SCC of unknown primary?",
      sample_answer: "PET-CT is instrumental in the management of SCC of unknown primary for several reasons: Detection of the Primary Tumor: PET-CT is highly sensitive and can often detect primary tumors that are not identified by other modalities. Accurate Staging: It helps in accurate staging of the cancer by identifying all sites of disease involvement, both regional and distant. Treatment Planning: The detailed information from PET-CT guides the comprehensive planning of radiotherapy and can influence surgical planning by delineating the extent of disease. Response Monitoring and Surveillance: After treatment, PET-CT is used to monitor response to therapy and for surveillance to detect recurrence early.",
    },
    {
      question: "What are the indications of PET-CT in ENT practice?",
      sample_answer: "Diagnostic Indications: PET-CT is indicated for evaluating patients with a clinical suspicion of having an unknown primary head and neck SCC, especially when initial workup with other imaging modalities is inconclusive. Staging: It is used for staging of cancers, particularly lymphoma or advanced head and neck cancers, such as T4 tumors of the hypopharynx or nasopharynx, and to assess the N3 nodal status in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Assessment of Recurrence: PET-CT is also employed to detect recurrence in patients previously treated for head and neck cancers, particularly when there is a clinical suspicion based on symptoms or physical findings.",
    },
    {
      question: "What do you do if the cytology is EBER positive?",
      sample_answer: "If the cytology is EBER positive, indicating Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) involvement, it suggests a strong likelihood of nasopharyngeal carcinoma, especially in appropriate epidemiological contexts. The management would include: Targeted Biopsies: Directed biopsies of the nasopharynx, even if initial examinations do not reveal obvious lesions, to confirm the diagnosis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Specific Treatment Planning: Depending on the extent of the disease and patient factors, treatment may involve radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or a combination of both, tailored to the specific characteristics of EBV-associated malignancies. Monitoring and Follow-up: Given the association of EBV with nasopharyngeal carcinoma, regular monitoring through imaging and endoscopy is critical to detect recurrence or progression early.",
