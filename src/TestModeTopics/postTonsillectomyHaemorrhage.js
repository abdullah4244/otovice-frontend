      question: "Your registrar calls you about a 2 year old boy brought by his mother to the emergency department with a history of bleeding from his mouth 12 hours after a tonsillectomy done for OSA. How do you classify post-tonsillectomy hemorrhage?",
      sample_answer: "Post-tonsillectomy hemorrhage is generally classified into two types: primary (or reactionary), occurring within the first 24 hours after surgery, and secondary, which occurs after 24 hours, typically around 5-10 days post-operatively.",

    {
      question: "What do you want to know over the phone from your registrar?",
      sample_answer: "I would like to know about the volume of bleeding, is it still active or has it stopped, any preceding activities or symptoms, history of bleeding disorders in the patient or family, and details of the initial tonsillectomy procedure, including technique and any intraoperative complications, as well as the patient's haemodynamic and airway status.",

      question: "The child has spit out about an egg cup full of blood, she is haemodynamically stable and breathing normally with no added sounds. The tonsillectomy was performed via a cold steel approach with ties and there were no intraoperative complications. How will you manage this patient?",
      sample_answer: "I follow the APLS approach, emphasizing the ABCDE framework, while closely collaborating with the paediatrics, anaesthetics and emergency department teams to simultaneously assess and resuscitate the child. I would have the child sitting up and leaning forward to reduce the risk of aspiration while I assess the airway by listening for added sounds and looking for obstruction caused by blood closts or tissue. We would be ready to intubate the child if the airway is compromised. In terms of Breathing I would Administer high-flow oxygen via a non-rebreathing mask to maintain oxygen saturation while Assessing the respiratory rate, oxygen saturations and for signs of distress such as nasal flaring, tracheal tug and intercostal recession. For Circulation we would Establish IV access immediately for fluid resuscitation and blood products if necessary. I would note the patient's mental status, the heart rate, blood pressure and capillary refill time looking for signs of shock. I would Administer IV fluids, starting with a 20 mL/kg bolus of isotonic solution. We would Prepare for potential transfusion by sending samples for full blood count, crossmatch, and coagulation profile. I also commence tranexaemic acid if it is not contraindicated. For disability I evaluate consciousness level using the AVPU scale (Alert, responds to Voice, responds to Pain, Unresponsive) while Monitoring for any signs of decreased consciousness due to blood loss or shock. In Exposure I Fully assess the patient, including the oropharyngeal cavity, to identify the source of bleeding if it is visible and assess its severity. If there is active bleeding and the patient is cooperative, I apply pressure to the bleeding area with an adrenaline and tranexaemic acid soaked swab. In such a case i laise with my my anaesthetist to intubate the child so we can protect their airway an take them to theatre to arrest the haemorrhage.",

      question: "What comprises conservative management in a patient who is no longer bleeding?",
      sample_answer: "If a post-tonsillectomy patient presents with bleeding that has spontaneously stopped, conservative management focuses on observation, hydration, pain management, and preventing further episodes. This includes: Monitoring vital signs closely to detect any signs of recurrent bleeding or hemodynamic instability. An initial nil by mouth period supported by intravenous hydration before reinstituting a normal diet. Intravenous tranexaemic acid if there are no contraindications and hydrogen peroxide gargles if tolerated. Antibiotics may be helpful but the evidence is limited.",
    },
    {
      question: "What are the intraoperative surgical options and techniques do you use to stop post-tonsillectomy bleeding?",
      sample_answer: "I am usually able to control the bleeding with a combination of the following methods; Applying direct pressure to the bleeding site with swabs to control minor bleeding. Using bipolar diathermy for precise cauterization of bleeding vessels. Tying off bleeding vessels directly with a silk suture is useful for more significant or arterial bleeds. I can then place a surgicel in the tonsillar fossa and suture the tonsillar pillars together with a round-bodied vicryl suture. In rare cases where bleeding cannot be controlled by other means, I can pack the oropharynx and transfer the patient to ITU while I plan for interventional radiological embolisation.",
    },
    {
      question: "What are the stages of shock and what are the signs of each stage?",
      sample_answer: "The stages of shock include: Grade I (Mild): Characterized by less than 15% volume loss, presenting with symptoms like mild tachycardia but generally alert and oriented. Grade II (Moderate): Involves 15-30% volume loss, showing signs of anxiety, moderate tachycardia, increased capillary refill time. Grade III (Severe): Entails 30-40% blood volume loss, with symptoms including agitation, hypotension, pronounced tachycardia, and increased respiratory rate. Grade IV (Critical): Indicates more than 40% volume loss, presenting with confusion, profound hypotension, and rapid deterioration.",

    {
      question: "How do you calculate dehydration in a child?",
      sample_answer: "Dehydration in a child can be estimated based on clinical signs and symptoms, and percentage body weight loss. For a rough calculation: Mild dehydration: 5% body weight loss. Moderate dehydration: 5-10% body weight loss. Severe dehydration: >10% body weight loss. Clinical assessment includes checking for dry mucous membranes, decreased tear production, reduced urine output, lethargy, and increased heart rate. Precise calculation requires knowing the child's usual weight and current weight to determine the percentage loss.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is the circulating volume of a child? How do you estimate a child's weight?",
      sample_answer: "Circulating volume is approximately 70-80 mL/kg in children. To estimate weight, a useful formula is (Age in years + 4) Ã— 2 for children older than 1 year. This formula gives an approximate weight in kilograms, which is crucial for calculating fluid requirements and medication dosages.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do you calculate pediatric resuscitation fluid volume?",
      sample_answer: "For resuscitation, the initial fluid bolus is usually 20 mL/kg of isotonic crystalloid, which can be repeated based on the response and ongoing assessment of the child's condition",
    },
    {
      question: "How do you calculate pediatric maintenance fluid volume?",
      sample_answer: "Pediatric maintenance fluid volume is calculated using the Holliday-Segar method, which recommends 100 mL/kg for the first 10 kg of body weight, 50 mL/kg for the next 10 kg, and 20 mL/kg for each additional kilogram of body weight over 20 kg per day.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is the blood supply of the tonsil?",
      sample_answer: "The tonsil's blood supply is primarily from five arteries: the tonsillar branch of the facial artery, ascending pharyngeal artery, ascending palatine artery (from the facial artery), lesser palatine artery (from the descending palatine artery of the internal maxillary artery), and the dorsal lingual branch of the lingual artery.",

    {
      question: "What are the considerations for tonsillectomy in patients with Jehovah's Witness?",
      sample_answer: "For Jehovah's Witness patients undergoing tonsillectomy: I would Discuss all treatment options and understand the patient's (or guardian's) wishes regarding blood transfusion alternatives. Plan for meticulous surgical technique to minimize bleeding risks, including preoperative optimization of hemoglobin levels if necessary. Consider using blood conservation strategies, such as cell salvage, and non-blood volume expanders. Employ all available hemostatic measures intraoperatively, including careful cauterization and the use of topical hemostatic agents. Engage in detailed preoperative planning with the surgical, anesthesiology, and pediatric teams to ensure all possible measures are in place to avoid transfusion. However, if despite these measures, there is significant bleeding and it is a life threatening emergency, I would treat in the child's best interest and transfuse if needed.",
