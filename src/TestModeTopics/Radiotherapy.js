      question: "What is going on here?",
      sample_answer: "This is a clinical photograph of a patient having a radiotherapy mask fitted. It is also called a mould or shell and serves to keep the patient's head still during radiotherapy treatments to allow accurate delivery of the radiation.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is this?",
      sample_answer: "This is a planning scan for intensity modulated radiotherapy. This uses 3D modelling to deliver higher doses of therapy to the tumour bed, as indicated by the red area, whilst sparing uninvolved structures. It achieves this by using a combination of beams from different directions.",
    },
    {
      question: "What type of cancer do you think is being treated in this image?",
      sample_answer: "This is likely radiotherapy for a nasopharyngeal cancer. Radiotherapy is the primary treatment modality for these cancers, particularly in stage 1 and 2 disease.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is this image?",
      sample_answer: "This is an orthopantomogram. In the context of radiation therapy, this is performed prior to treatment in order to identify and treat any dental disease in the radiation field, as a means to mitigate risks of osteoradionecrosis following the radiotherapy.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is radiotherapy?",
      sample_answer: "Radiotherapy is a treatment modality that delivers energy to kill malignant cells in the area specifically targeted by the clinician. It involves the use of ionizing radiation, which can be internal, such as brachytherapy and radioiodine, or external, such as photon, gamma rays, electrons, neutrons, and protons. This treatment is often used alone or in conjunction with surgery and/or systemic therapy to treat a wide range of tumors, maximizing tumor control and quality of life while minimizing toxicity and preserving organs.",
    },
    {
      question: "How does radiotherapy work?",
      sample_answer: "Radiotherapy works by damaging the DNA of cancer cells through ionizing the atoms that make up the DNA chain. This damage, especially the direct damage leading to generation of double-strand breaks in DNA, is considered the dominant factor that causes cellular lethality. There is also indirect damage to other cell components e.g. from free radicals. While both malignant and normal cells in the treatment field are subject to the ionizing effects of radiation, normal cells are generally better at repairing the damage, using molecular machinery to detect and repair DNA breaks and mutations. This differential repair capacity between normal and malignant cells makes radiotherapy effective against cancer.",

    {
      question: "What determines the sensitivity of a tumor to radiotherapy?",
      sample_answer: "The sensitivity of a tumor to radiotherapy is determined by several factors. Larger tumors tend to have a more hypoxic center, making them less sensitive to radiation because fewer free radicals are generated, which are crucial for causing damage to the cancer cells. Oxygenated cells are more susceptible to radiation, making exophytic tumors, which are typically well-vascularized, more susceptible to radiation injury, whereas ulcerative and infiltrative tumors are less vascularized and more resistant. The cell death caused by radiation occurs during cell proliferation, usually after 45 times of division before lysis, making rapidly growing tumors more susceptible to injury. Additionally, cells are more radiosensitive during mitosis and the late G1 and early S-phases of the cell cycle.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is fractionation and what are the methods of it?",
      sample_answer: "Fractionation is the method of delivering radiotherapy in smaller doses over a period, typically dosing 5 days a week for 57 weeks, rather than all at once. This approach allows for various biological processes that increase the effectiveness of treatment and reduce toxicity. These processes include reassortment, allowing cells to proceed to more radiosensitive stages in their cell cycle; reoxygenation, making previously more hypoxic cells more susceptible; repopulation, where prolonged waiting between fractions results in the regrowth of tumor cells from sublethal damage; and repair, where normal tissue tends to recover more quickly from sublethal damage compared to tumor cells. Methods of fractionation include conventional fractionation, pure hyperfractionation, accelerated (standard) fractionation, accelerated hyperfractionation, concomitant boost accelerated fractionation, and hypofractionation.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is the usual treatment regimen for head and neck cancer?",
      sample_answer: "The usual treatment regimen for head and neck cancer involves 6070 Gy delivered over 3035 fractions for primary or radical radiotherapy over 67 weeks. Adjuvant post-operative radiotherapy typically involves 60 Gy in 30 fractions over a 6-week period. This regimen is often used in combination with chemotherapy, particularly for locoregionally advanced lesions, as a definitive organ function-preserving approach or following surgery as an adjuvant. N0 necks may get 54 grey.",

    {
      question: "What are the benefits of IMRT in head and neck radiotherapy?",
      sample_answer: "The benefits of Intensity-Modulated Radiotherapy (IMRT) in head and neck cancer include improved targeting of the tumor with reduced radiation exposure to surrounding healthy tissues, leading to lower rates of xerostomia and other side effects, thereby preserving quality of life. IMRT allows for the delivery of radiation doses that conform more precisely to the three-dimensional shape of the tumor, sparing critical structures and potentially improving tumor-related outcomes.",
    },
    {
      question: "What are the alternatives to IMRT?",
      sample_answer: "Alternatives to Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy include: Three-Dimensional Conformal Radiation Therapy which Shapes radiation beams to the tumor's contour but doesn't adjust beam intensity. Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy and Stereotactic Radiosurgery which Offers precise treatment for small, well-defined tumors in fewer sessions. Proton Beam Therapy which Utilizes protons for deep-seated tumors near critical structures, minimizing damage to surrounding tissues. Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy which is An advanced form that delivers radiation more quickly by rotating around the patient. Brachytherapy which Places radioactive sources directly inside or near the tumor, effectively treating certain cancers like prostate and cervical. Conventional Radiation Therapy which Employs fixed fields and uniform beam intensity, a more basic option where advanced technology is unavailable. And Adaptive Radiation Therapy which Adjusts the plan based on changes in tumor size or anatomy during treatment, applicable with various radiation techniques.",

      question: "What are the side effects of radiotherapy?",
      sample_answer: "The side effects of radiotherapy can be categorized into early (acute) and late (chronic) side effects, depending on their time of onset relative to the treatment. Early Side Effects include Cutaneous Reactions: Includes dryness, erythema, hyperpigmentation, desquamation, and pruritus, managed with skin moisturizers, mild skin cleaning, and corticosteroid creams. Mucositis: Tender, erythematous, and swollen mucous membranes, with increased risk of infections, managed with aggressive oral hygiene, nutritional supplements, and oral and topical anesthetics. Alopecia: Temporary hair loss within the radiation field, potentially permanent at higher doses. Xerostomia/Dental Caries: Resulting from the sensitivity of salivary acinar cells to radiation, managed with fluids, artificial saliva, pilocarpine, and aggressive oral hygiene. Late Side Effects include Osteoradionecrosis of the Mandible and Chondroradionecrosis of the Larynx which Manifest as hypocellularity, hypovascularity, and ischemia of tissue. This is managed conservatively initially, with possible need for debridement or free tissue transfer in severe cases. Radiation-Induced Cancer is possibel as there is Increased risk of cancers such as thyroid, salivary gland, temporal bone cancer, leukemia, and sarcoma. Otologic Sequelae include otitis externa, serous otitis media, and auricular chondritis. Lens sensitivity to radiation leads to cataracts with doses as low as 6 Gy. Hypothyroidism Occurs in 2025% of patients after neck radiation. There is a Risk of carotid artery bleeding leading to potentially fatal blowout injury. Dysphagia, Stricture, Stenosis and Nonfunctional Larynx can Result from chemoradiation-induced fibrosis, possibly requiring feeding tube or repeat dilation procedures, and chronic aspiration, potentially necessitating a tracheostomy. Nerve palsies, particularly affecting the hypoglossal and accessory nerves.",

      question: "What is osteoradionecrosis and its pathophysiology?",
      sample_answer: "Osteoradionecrosis (ORN) is a condition characterized by non-healing exposed bone in a previously irradiated field, persisting for at least three months. The pathophysiology of ORN includes vascular inflammation and fibrosis secondary to radiotherapy, leading to tissue hypovascularisation and hypoxic injury, making the area susceptible to necrosis and secondary anaerobic infection. The mandible is more susceptible due to its type of bone and blood supply, particularly in the anterior segments",
    },
    {
      question: "How do you manage a patient with mandibular ORN?",
      sample_answer: "Management of mandibular ORN involves both non-surgical and surgical strategies. Non-surgical options include improving nutrition status, smoking cessation, treating infection, controlling risk factors like diabetes and stopping bisphosphonates, with limited evidence supporting the use of hyperbaric oxygen and medications such as pentoxyphylline and tocopherol. Surgical options involve resecting necrotic bone and reconstructing with soft tissue or free flaps, such as a fibula free flap, often following a biopsy to exclude recurrence.",
