      question: "What is your differential diagnosis for a midline lesion over the dorsum of the nose?",
      sample_answer: "For a midline lesion over the dorsum of the nose, my differential diagnosis would include: Nasal Dermoid Cyst: These are formed from trapped ectodermal and mesodermal elements during embryological fusion, potentially containing skin, hair follicles, and sebaceous glands. They may present as a mass, nasal deformity, or sinus tract opening onto the skin, and can extend intracranially in up to 45% of cases. Nasal Glioma: This consists of dysplastic glial cells, usually found without an intracranial connection. It's typically non-compressible, with a purple/blue hue, located paramedian on the glabella. Nasal Encephalocele: Resulting from a neural tube defect, this condition involves herniation of cranial contents through a skull defect. It is CSF-filled due to communication with the subarachnoid space and may present as a pulsatile, compressible mass that expands with crying or straining. Meningoencephalocele: Similar to encephaloceles, these contain both meninges and brain tissue, demonstrating similar clinical features. Other considerations in the differential would be vascular lesions (like hemangiomas or arteriovenous malformations), infectious/inflammatory causes (such as polyps or rhinoliths), congenital anomalies (including nasolacrimal duct cysts), and less commonly, neoplastic/mass-forming entities such as neurofibromas.",

      question: "Lets say this is a 6 year old male with a lesion over the dorsum of his nose. What would you ask in your history?",
      sample_answer: "I would ask about: Timing and Growth Pattern: When the lesion was first noticed and how its size has changed, especially any rapid increase. Exacerbating Features: Whether the size of the mass increases with crying or straining, suggesting a connection to intracranial pressure (indicative of encephalocele). Symptoms of Infection: Any history of recurrent infections, pus discharge, or previous meningitis, which could suggest intracranial extension. Obstruction Symptoms: Complaints of nasal congestion or breathing difficulties, particularly if the mass is intranasal. Other Anomalies: Any associated congenital anomalies or developmental delays, as nasal dermoids can be associated with a range of other conditions.",
    },
    {
      question: "What would you look for during your examination of this patient?",
      sample_answer: "During examination, I would look for: Location and Characteristics of the Mass: Specifically, a midline position, its consistency, and any discoloration. Punctum or Pit Presence: Indicative of a nasal dermoid cyst. Hair protruding from such a pit is pathognomonic. Compressibility and Pulsation: To assess for encephalocele, which would be compressible and potentially pulsatile. Furstenberg Sign: Compression of the internal jugular vein to see if the mass increases in size, suggesting venous connection seen in encephaloceles. Anterior rhinoscopy and flexible nasendoscopy to assess for intranasal components. Transillumination: For encephaloceles, to check if the mass transilluminates, indicating the presence of CSF. Signs of Infection or Inflammation: Any signs suggesting previous or ongoing infection.",
    },
    {
      question: "What investigations would you undertake for this patient?",
      sample_answer: "For this patient, I would undertake: Beta-2 Transferrin Test: If rhinorrhoea is present, to test for a CSF leak. CT Scan: To assess the bony anatomy, identify any bony defects, and look for indicators of intracranial extension like a bifid crista galli or orbital widening. MRI: For soft-tissue delineation, to evaluate the full extent of the lesion, its relationship to surrounding structures, and to assess for any intracranial extension. Endoscopy: To evaluate the intranasal component, if present, and better understand the lesion's extent.",
    },
    {
      question: "How would you describe the embryological origins of midline nasal masses, specifically focusing on dermoid cysts, nasal gliomas, and encephaloceles?",
      sample_answer: "Midline nasal masses originate from disturbances in the complex processes of embryonic development of the nose and skull base. Nasal Dermoids: Arise due to defective obliteration of dural tissue, where dura projects through the fonticulus nasofrontalis to the skin but then retracts, potentially leaving a connection to dura or trapping ectodermal and mesodermal elements, leading to the formation of a dermoid cyst. Nasal Gliomas: Are thought to result from dysplastic glial cells that are misplaced during the development of the neural tube. They lose their intracranial connection but may remain attached to the dura by a fibrous stalk. Encephaloceles: Occur due to a failure in the neural tube closure, leading to herniation of cranial contents through defects in the skull base.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do you know any associated anomalies for nasal dermoids?",
      sample_answer: "Nasal dermoids can be associated with several anomalies, including aural atresia, mental retardation, spinal column abnormalities, hydrocephalus, hypertelorism, hemifacial microsomia, albinism, corpus callosum agenesis, cerebral atrophy, lumbar lipoma, dermal cyst of the frontal lobe, cleft lip and palate, tracheoesophageal fistula, and coronary artery, cardiac, genital, and cerebral anomalies. These associated anomalies occur in a significant range of cases, reported from 5% to 41%.",
    },
    {
      question: "Tell me about nasal encephaloceles.",
      sample_answer: "Nasal encephaloceles are congenital anomalies where brain tissue and meninges herniate through a defect in the skull, protruding into the nasal cavity or the skin overlying the nose. They are caused by a failure in the closure of the anterior neuropore during embryogenesis. These can be classified by location as occipital, sincipital (including frontoethmoidal, nasofrontal, nasoethmoidal, and nasoorbital), or basal. Symptoms include a bluish, soft, pulsatile mass that can change size with crying or straining, and may be confused with nasal polyps. They can lead to meningitis, nasal obstruction, cosmetic deformity, and hydrocephalus. Treatment involves surgical excision and closure of the dural defect to prevent complications.",
    },
    {
      question: "Tell me about nasal gliomas.",
      sample_answer: "Nasal gliomas are non-malignant congenital growths composed of heterotopic glial tissue, thought to arise from a separation of glial tissue from the brain during development. They can be located externally on the nasal dorsum, internally within the nasal cavity, or in both areas, with a potential fibrous stalk connecting to the dura. These lesions do not communicate with the brain's subarachnoid space, distinguishing them from encephaloceles. Nasal gliomas present as firm, nonpulsatile masses that do not transilluminate. Diagnosis involves imaging, typically MRI or CT, to rule out intracranial extension. Treatment is surgical excision, sometimes requiring a combined approach for lesions with intracranial extension.",
    },
    {
      question: "What are your treatment options for a nasal dermoid?",
      sample_answer: "Treatment for a nasal dermoid primarily involves surgical excision, with the goal of complete removal to prevent recurrence, infection, or potential intracranial complications. The approach can vary based on the lesion's extent, whether there is intracranial extension, and the presence of a sinus tract. Options range from simple excision for superficial lesions to more complex approaches like open rhinoplasty or external approaches for deeper lesions. Intracranial extension may require a combined neurosurgical and otolaryngological approach for safe removal.",

    {
      question: "Tell me about your surgical approaches to a nasal dermoid.",
      sample_answer: "For Small, superficial dermoids localized to the nasal tip or dorsum direct excision through a small incision placed over the lesion may be sufficient. Care is taken to excise the cyst and tract in toto to prevent recurrence. This approach leaves minimal scarring. For Deep Dermoids with Intranasal or Extranasal Involvement the approaches include external rhinoplasty, midline vertical incision and transverse nasal incision. The External Rhinoplasty Approach is useful for lesions that extend deeper or involve the nasal bones, as it offers excellent exposure. This technique involves a transcolumellar incision connected to bilateral marginal incisions, allowing the nasal skin to be elevated and the cyst and tract to be dissected out completely. The Midline Vertical Incision is Especially useful for midline lesions, and provides direct access to the cyst and its tract. The incision can be extended superiorly for better access to deeper or higher located dermoids. The Transverse Nasal Incision is suitable for dermoids located at the nasofrontal angle. The incision is hidden at the junction between the nasal dorsum and the forehead, allowing good cosmetic outcomes. For Dermoids with Intracranial Extension approaches include bicoronal flap and craniotomy or endoscopic approaches. The Bicoronal Flap and Craniotomy is suitable For dermoids with suspected intracranial extension, as it provides broad access to the frontal bone and the anterior cranial fossa. Craniotomy allows for direct visualization and repair of the dural defect, removal of the intracranial portion of the dermoid, and ensures a watertight closure to prevent CSF leakage. In selected cases, especially when the intracranial extension is minimal, an endoscopic approach can be utilized to excise the cyst and tract. This method offers the benefit of minimal invasiveness but requires considerable endoscopic expertise. Combined approaches exist for complex dermoids that extend across different anatomical regions.",

    {
      question: "How would you treat it if it were a glioma?",
      sample_answer: "The surgical approach depends on the glioma's location: Intranasal Gliomas: Can often be removed endoscopically, providing a less invasive option with minimal scarring. Extranasal Gliomas: Typically require an external approach for complete excision. A skin incision over the lesion allows for direct access and removal. Gliomas with Intracranial Extension: More complex and require a multidisciplinary approach, potentially including craniotomy, to ensure complete removal and to address any connection to intracranial structures.",
    },
    {
      question: "How would you treat it if it were an encephalocele?",
      sample_answer: "For nasal encephaloceles, surgical treatment focuses on removing herniated tissue, repairing skull base defects to prevent CSF leakage, and improving appearance. Strategies vary with encephalocele location: Sincipital (Anterior) Encephaloceles Frontoethmoidal: Approach through bifrontal or frontal craniotomy to reduce herniated brain tissue and close the anterior skull base defect. Reconstruction aims for optimal cosmetic outcomes. Nasoethmoidal and Nasofrontal: Similar approach to frontoethmoidal, ensuring careful dissection and cosmetically acceptable nasal bridge reconstruction. Basal Encephaloceles Transnasal Endoscopic Approach: Suitable for smaller basal encephaloceles, this minimally invasive method repairs the skull base defect through nasal passages, avoiding external incisions. Transcranial Approach: For larger basal encephaloceles, a craniotomy allows direct defect repair but requires longer recovery. Combined Approaches Some cases need both endoscopic and transcranial methods for comprehensive repair. Surgical Principles Herniated Tissue Management: Non-functional, gently reduced or resected to prevent CSF leakage or meningitis. Skull Base Repair: Defect repair may use autologous grafts or synthetic materials for a watertight closure. Cosmetic Reconstruction: Addresses deformities for optimal aesthetic outcomes. Postoperative Care Involves CSF leakage, infection monitoring, and follow-up imaging to assess repair success and no recurrence. Long-term follow-up checks on development and neurologic function.",
