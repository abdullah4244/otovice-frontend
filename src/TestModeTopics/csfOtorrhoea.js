    {
      question: "Please describe this audiogram",
      sample_answer: "This is a pure tone audiogram showing normal hearing on the right but mild to moderate conductive hearing loss on the left.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is your differential diagnosis for unilateral conductive hearing loss?",
      sample_answer: "The differential diagnosis for unilateral conductive hearing loss can include Obstructive Causes such as Cerumen impaction, Foreign bodies and External ear canal stenosis such as exostoses and osteomas. Infectious or Inflammatory Causes such as Otitis externa, Acute otitis media, Chronic otitis media and otitis media with effusion. Traumatic or Mechanical Causes such as temporal bone fractures, iatrogenic causes post surgery, or Tympanic membrane perforation. Ossicular Chain Abnormalities such as Otosclerosis or Ossicular chain discontinuity. Tumors which can be benign or malignant such as jugulotympanic paraganglioma. Congenital Anomalies such as atresia of the external auditory canal as may occur with microtia or malformations of the ossicles.",
    },
    {
      question: "What would you inquire about during your history taking for this patient?",
      sample_answer: "I would enquire about onset and duration of hearing loss and whether it was sudden or gradual. The presence of any precipitating events, such as head injury, which could suggest a temporal bone fracture, haemotympanum or ossicular chain disruption. Past episodes of ear infections, surgeries, or similar symptoms in either ear. Associated symptoms such as otorrhea, otalgia, tinnitus, or vertigo, which can suggest specific etiologies like chronic otitis media or inner ear involvement. History of upper respiratory tract infections that may precede ear problems acute otitis media. I would like to find out about their General medical history and family history of similar problems.",
    },
    {
      question: "What would you look for during your examination of this patient?",
      sample_answer: "I would perform Visual inspection for any abnormalities or asymmetries in the external ear structure, signs of inflammation, or discharge. I would perform Otoscopic examination to evaluate the tympanic membrane for its color, mobility, integrity, the presence of fluid behind the tympanic membrane, signs of infection, or masses. Weber and Rinne tuning fork tests would help me to differentiate between conductive and sensorineural hearing loss. I would perform Nasopharyngoscopy to rule out tumors or other obstructions in the nasopharynx that could affect eustachian tube function.",
    },
    {
      question: "Please describe what you see on otoscopy",
      sample_answer: "This is an otoendoscopic photograph of a left ear with fluid and multiple bubbles behind the tympanic membrane.",
    },
    {
      question: "What investigations would you carry out if you saw this?",
      sample_answer: "My initial investigations would include pure tone audiometry and tympanometry. I would consider a HRCT of the temporal bones if had any diagnostic uncertainty from my history and examination.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is tympanometry?",
      sample_answer: "Tympanometry is an audiometric test that evaluates the condition of the middle ear and the mobility of the tympanic membrane (TM) and the conduction bones by creating variations of air pressure in the ear canal. It measures the energy that is transmitted through or reflected back from the middle ear under varying air pressure conditions. The primary purpose is to detect fluid in the middle ear, tympanic membrane perforations, eustachian tube function, and otosclerosis, among others.",
    },
    {
      question: "What are the components of a tympanogram?",
      sample_answer: "A tympanogram is a graph that represents the compliance (mobility) of the tympanic membrane as air pressure in the external auditory canal is varied. The key components of a tympanogram include: Ear canal volume: Measured before the tympanic membrane moves, indicative of ear canal size. In adults this is normaly 0.9 to 2cc, whilst in children it is between 0.3 to 1 cc. Compliance: The peak of the graph represents the maximum compliance of the tympanic membrane, indicating how well it moves in response to pressure changes. The normal value is around 0.3 to 1.7ml. Pressure: The x-axis represents the air pressure applied to the ear canal, ranging from positive to negative. The peak compliance typically occurs near the atmospheric pressure if the middle ear system is normal. This is normally between -100 and +50 decapascals.",
    },
    {
      question: "What are your differential diagnoses for the otoscopic appearance of a fluid behind a tympanic membrane?",
      sample_answer: "They include: Otitis media with effusion, Acute otitis media and CSF otorrhea.",
    },
    {
      question: "You take the patient for grommet insertion and on making your myringotomy, you get continuous clear fluid. What do you do in the immediate situation?",
      sample_answer: "I would stop the procedure, collect fluid for beta 2 transferring testing, place the patient head up and pack the ear canal with spongistan. I would then arrange further investigations and consult my neurosurgical colleagues after explaining to patient what has happened.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do you further investigate this patient?",
      sample_answer: "I would organise Beta-2 transferrin testing of the collected fluid to confirm it as CSF. I would organise High-resolution CT scan of the temporal bones to identify bony defects, fractures, or areas of thinning that may be the source of the CSF leak. I would perform an MRI of the brain and temporal bones to assess for any meningoencephaloceles, dural defects, or brain tissue herniations into the middle ear or mastoid cavity. CT cisternography or MR cisternography, may be helpful if the source of the leak is not identified on standard imaging.",
    },
    {
      question: "What are the potential causes of CSF otorrhoea?",
      sample_answer: "Potential causes of CSF otorrhea can be categorized as: Traumatic: Resulting from head injuries that cause fractures of the skull base, particularly the temporal bone. Iatrogenic: Following ear or skull surgery that inadvertently creates a path for CSF leakage. Neoplastic: Tumors that erode the bone and dural barriers, allowing CSF to escape. Infectious: Severe infections that lead to bone erosion. Congenital: Abnormalities in the development of the skull base, such as a defect in the tegmen tympani or mastoideum, that allow for abnormal communication between the subarachnoid space and the middle ear. Spontaneous: In cases of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), thinning and dehiscence can occur without a clear precipitating factor.",
    },
    {
      question: "How would you manage this if it were related to a meningoencephalocoele through a tegmen defect?",
      sample_answer: "I would approach treatment through a combination of conservative, medical, and surgical strategies, tailoring the intervention to the patient's specific needs and the severity of the CSF leak. Initially, I would recommend conservative management, especially for minor CSF leaks that have a potential to resolve spontaneously. This would include: Encouraging Bed Rest: I would advise the patient to rest with the head of the bed elevated to decrease CSF pressure and promote the natural closure of the leak. Minimizing Straining: I would recommend avoiding activities that could increase intracranial pressure, such as heavy lifting, straining during bowel movements, or vigorous coughing and sneezing. Ensuring Proper Hydration and Stool Softeners: To reduce the need for straining, maintaining good hydration and using stool softeners would be part of my recommendations. Observing for Changes: Close monitoring would be essential to detect any signs of increased leakage, signs of meningitis, or other complications. For medical management aimed at reducing CSF production or preventing infection, I would consider: Prescribing Acetazolamide to decrease CSF production by inhibiting carbonic anhydrase. Evaluating the Use of Prophylactic Antibiotics: Although controversial, the use of antibiotics might be considered in cases with a high risk of meningitis, weighing the benefits against the risk of resistance. Recommending Vaccination: To lower the risk of bacterial meningitis, vaccination against pneumococcal meningitis would be advised. Should conservative and medical measures prove insufficient or if the leak is significant and persistent, I would opt for surgical intervention which can be done vial transmastoid or middle fossa approaches to directly repair the defect.",
    },
    {
      question: "How would you surgically manage this case?",
      sample_answer: "Surgical management in cases of CSF otorrhea through a tegmen defect involves: Preoperative preparation: Includes imaging to precisely locate the defect and planning the surgical approach. Approach selection: Based on the defect's location and size, either a transmastoid approach for smaller defects or a middle fossa approach for larger or more anteriorly located defects might be chosen. A combined approach may be required for extensive defects. Defect repair: The goal is to achieve a watertight closure. This may involve the use of autologous materials (such as fascia, muscle, or bone) and synthetic materials (like hydroxyapatite or titanium mesh) to repair the defect. Dural repair: If there is a dural tear, it must be repaired directly or covered with a graft. Encephalocele management: Any herniated brain tissue is typically resected, and the defect in the dura is repaired. Postoperative management: Includes measures to reduce CSF pressure, such as lumbar drainage if necessary, and monitoring for signs of CSF leak or infection. The patient is advised on activity restrictions to promote healing. Long-term follow-up: Monitoring for recurrence of symptoms, hearing assessment, and possibly repeat imaging to ensure the integrity of the repair.",
