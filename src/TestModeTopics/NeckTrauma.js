      question: "How is neck trauma classified?",
      sample_answer: "Neck trauma classification involves several key factors, including the mechanism of injury, which can be high versus low velocity or penetrating versus blunt trauma. The severity and potential complications differ significantly between high and low-velocity impacts, and between penetrating and blunt forces. Additionally, the presence or absence of penetration through the platysma layer plays a crucial role in determining the risk level of the injury. Penetrating injuries that breach the platysma are generally considered more serious and warrant a thorough investigation for underlying damage to vital structures. The classification also considers the anatomical zones of the neck, which helps in assessing the likely injured structures and guides the diagnostic and management strategies.",

      question: "What are the zones of the neck?",
      sample_answer: "The neck is anatomically divided into three zones to guide the assessment and management of neck trauma. Zone I extends from the clavicle to the cricoid cartilage. This zone includes critical structures such as the aortic arch, brachiocephalic vessels, subclavian vessels, common carotid arteries, trachea, esophagus, thyroid gland, and the thoracic duct on the left. Injuries in this zone are potentially life-threatening due to the high risk of vascular and airway compromise. Zone II ranges from the cricoid cartilage to the angle of the mandible. It contains the carotid arteries, jugular veins, larynx, pharynx, and esophagus, among others. Zone II injuries are the most common and are considered relatively more accessible for surgical exploration and repair. Zone III spans from the angle of the mandible to the base of the skull. It encompasses the distal carotid arteries, jugular veins, several cranial nerves, and parts of the pharynx. Injuries in Zone III are challenging to access surgically due to the dense bone and limited space, often requiring endovascular or specialized surgical approaches.",

      question: "You are called to a patient in the emergency department who is hoarse after a road traffic accident. How do you proceed?",
      sample_answer: "Upon encountering a patient with hoarseness following a road traffic accident, my first step is to stabilize the patient according to ATLS principles, prioritizing airway management due to the potential for laryngeal injury. The presence of hoarseness suggests a significant impact to the larynx or vocal cords, potentially threatening the airway. After ensuring cervical spine stabilization, I would assess the airway for signs of compromise, such as stridor, and perform or arrange for a careful examination, including flexible nasolaryngoscopy, to directly visualize the vocal cords and the laryngeal structure. This allows for the assessment of vocal cord mobility and identification of possible lacerations, hematomas, or fractures. Concurrently, I would ensure that breathing and circulation are stable, administering oxygen and establishing intravenous access as needed.",
    },
    {
      question: "The patient is stable after your primary survey. What do you do?",
      sample_answer: "With the patient stable after the primary survey, the next steps involve a thorough secondary survey to identify any additional injuries and detailed history taking to understand the mechanism of injury better. I would then proceed with imaging studies, including a CT scan of the neck with attention to the larynx and surrounding structures, to evaluate for fractures, soft tissue injuries, or other trauma-related changes. Depending on the CT findings and the patientâ€™s clinical presentation, further assessments like direct laryngoscopy, bronchoscopy, or an esophagram might be indicated to evaluate the airway, the integrity of the esophagus, and to rule out any associated injuries that might have been missed during the initial examination.",
    },
    {
      question: "Your CT scan shows a laryngeal fracture, and the patient is becoming unstable. How do you proceed?",
      sample_answer: "Upon identifying a laryngeal fracture in a patient who is becoming unstable, particularly with signs of airway compromise, the immediate priority is to secure the airway. Given the potential for worsening obstruction due to edema or hematoma, I would seek to transfer them to theatre to do this, but I would be prepared to perform a tracheostomy or a cricothyroidotomy which I would revise into a tracheostomy in theatre if less invasive methods of airway management, such as orotracheal or nasotracheal intubation, are not feasible or safe given the specific injury. After securing the airway, the patient would require urgent transfer to the operating room for surgical exploration and repair of the laryngeal fracture. During surgery, I would also perform a panendoscopy and pay careful attention to preserving the integrity of the laryngeal cartilages and ensuring proper alignment and fixation to maintain airway patency and vocal function. Post-operatively, the patient would be closely monitored in the ICU for signs of airway compromise, infection, or other complications.",

      question: "What are the soft and hard signs in neck trauma?",
      sample_answer: "Soft signs of neck trauma include dysphagia, dysphonia and a non-expansile hematoma These signs suggest an injury that may not be immediately life-threatening but requires further evaluation. Hard signs, which indicate a more urgent need for intervention, include active, uncontrolled bleeding, signs of shock, an expanding hematoma, air bubbling or surgical emphysema, hemoptysis or hematemesis, neurological decline and the presence of a bruit over injured vessels. The identification of hard signs necessitates immediate surgical exploration or intervention to prevent rapid deterioration of the patient's condition.",

    {
      question: "What are the differences between blunt and penetrating trauma?",
      sample_answer: "Blunt trauma is characterized by injuries resulting from impact or collision without the skin being penetrated, leading to a higher risk of skeletal fractures and soft tissue injuries. These injuries can cause significant internal damage without external wounds, making diagnosis and assessment more challenging. Penetrating trauma involves injuries where an object pierces the skin and internal tissues, directly injuring internal structures such as blood vessels, the airway, and the digestive tract. The management of penetrating trauma often requires surgical exploration based on the trajectory and depth of the injury, whereas blunt trauma management focuses on stabilizing internal injuries and managing complications like airway compromise and vascular injury.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do you manage vascular injuries in the context of neck trauma?",
      sample_answer: "Vascular injuries in neck trauma require prompt and precise management in an MDT setting with vascular surgeons in order to control bleeding and repair damaged vessels. Initial management involves applying direct pressure to the wound or using a balloon tamponade technique with a Foley catheter to control bleeding temporarily. Diagnostic imaging, particularly CT angiography, is employed to accurately define the extent and location of the vascular injury. In stable patients, endovascular repair techniques such as stenting or embolization may be appropriate, especially for injuries in anatomically challenging locations. Surgical exploration and direct repair, including bypass grafting or ligation, are considered based on the zone of injury, the specific vessels involved, and the patient's overall stability. The goal is to restore vascular integrity while minimizing the risk of complications such as stroke or hemorrhage.",

      question: "What is the Schaefer classification?",
      sample_answer: "The Schaefer classification system is a grading scale used to assess the severity of laryngeal trauma and guide management decisions. It categorizes injuries into five groups based on radiographic findings and clinical presentation: Group I: Minor endolaryngeal hematomas or lacerations without detectable fractures, managed conservatively with steroids, voice rest, and possibly antibiotics. Group II: More severe edema, hematoma, or minor mucosal disruption without exposed cartilage, also managed conservatively but with close monitoring. Group III: Massive edema, large mucosal lacerations, exposed cartilage, displaced fractures, or vocal cord immobility, requiring tracheostomy and surgical repair. Group IV: Similar to Group III but with more severe injuries including disruption of the anterior larynx and unstable fractures, necessitating emergent tracheostomy and repair. Group V: Complete laryngotracheal separation, which is a surgical emergency requiring airway management, supra- and infrahyoid release, and reanastomosis.",
    },
    {
      question: "How would you definitively manage a patient with blunt laryngeal trauma?",
      sample_answer: "Definitive management of a patient with blunt laryngeal trauma depends on the severity of the injury, as classified by the Schaefer system. For minor injuries without significant airway compromise (Group I or II), conservative treatment with corticosteroids, voice rest, and monitoring for any sign of worsening condition may suffice. More severe injuries (Groups III to V) typically necessitate surgical intervention. This could include tracheostomy for airway management, direct repair of lacerations, reduction and fixation of displaced cartilages, and potentially stenting for complex cases. The overarching goals are to restore the structural integrity of the larynx, ensure an adequate airway, and preserve vocal function to the greatest extent possible.",

      question: "How do you manage oesophageal injuries?",
      sample_answer: "Managing esophageal injuries involves initial stabilization, diagnostic evaluation, and tailored treatment based on injury timing and severity. Initial Assessment: Prioritize airway, breathing, and circulation. Secure the airway due to potential compromise from associated injuries or infection spread. Diagnostic Evaluation: Contrast Esophagram: Start with water-soluble contrast; if negative but suspicion remains, follow up with barium contrast. Endoscopy: Direct visualization of the injury, assessing mucosal damage extent. CT Scan: Identifies extraluminal air, fluid collections, and foreign bodies, providing injury extent and adjacent structure involvement. Classification of Injury: Classify based on depth (mucosal vs. full-thickness) and location (cervical, thoracic, abdominal). Management: Full-thickness Injuries within 24 Hours: Surgical repair is required, involving debridement, primary repair, and possibly reinforcement with tissue flaps. Contained or Partial-thickness Injuries: Conservative management with antibiotics, NPO status, and nutritional support via TPN or feeding jejunostomy. Delayed Diagnosis (>24 Hours): If stable and contained, pursue conservative management with antibiotics and nutritional support. Surgical intervention if sepsis develops or injury fails to heal. Monitoring and Supportive Care: Close monitoring for infection, mediastinitis, and respiratory compromise. Ensure nutritional support, pain management, and psychological support. Long-term Management: Follow-up for potential complications including stricture formation requiring endoscopic dilation and tracheoesophageal fistula development.",
