      question: "Please describe this image",
      sample_answer: "This is a coronal CT scan of the sinuses in a bony wonding showing a lesion filling the left maxillary and ethmoid sinuses as well as the nasal cavity. There is an area of dehiscence in the lateral wall of the maxillary sinus which is concerning for a malignant process. Similarly, there is either significant expansion or erosion of the medial wall of the maxillary sinus. I am unable to see the normal anatomy of the inferior turbinate on this side.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is your differential diagnosis for this picture?",
      sample_answer: "My differential diagnosis includes malignant processes such as squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, adenoid cystic carcinoma, and sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma, as well as benign processes such as inverted papilloma, a mucocoele and less likely things like antrochoanal polyp or chronic rhinosinusitis.",
    },
    {
      question: "What would you ask during your history for this patient?",
      sample_answer: "I would ask about unilateral nasal congestion (its timing and duration), any blood-stained discharge, headaches or facial pain, loose dentition, previous sinonasal disease (like inverted papilloma), rhinosinusitis, occupational exposure to carcinogens such as chromium, nickel, and wood dust, and any advanced symptoms like orbital involvement (proptosis, epiphora), cranial nerve issues (diplopia, hypoesthesia), or trismus. These questions help identify symptoms suggestive of both benign and malignant processes, and occupational exposure could indicate a higher risk for certain sinonasal cancers.",
    },
    {
      question: "What would you look for during your examination of this patient?",
      sample_answer: "I would examine the nose with anterior rhinoscopy and flexible nasendoscopy to assess the mass and it's extent. I would examine the oral cavity to look for signs of oropharyngeal involvement, and palpate the neck assess for any nodal disease. I would examine the eye for proptosis and visual changes. I would also perform a detailed cranial nerve examination to catch cranial nerve palsies such as those which occur with Gottfredson’s and Trotter’s syndrome.",
    },
    {
      question: "What investigations would you undertake for this patient?",
      sample_answer: "I would undertake CT for assessing bony landmarks and invasion, MRI for better visualization of soft tissue, orbital invasion, and carotid artery involvement. An ultrasound with Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology (FNAC) if there’s associated adenopathy and PET-CT for suspected metastases. An examination under anesthesia (EUA) plus biopsy would confirm the diagnosis, unless a vascular lesion is suspected.",
    },
    {
      question: "What are the risk factors for sinonasal cancers?",
      sample_answer: "Risk factors include exposure to toxins like chromium, nickel, hydrocarbons, and radiation; occupational exposure particularly in woodworkers (soft wood associated with SCC and hardwood with adenocarcinoma), and textile and metal workers; chronic infection and history of inverted papilloma.",

      question: "What is the breakdown of paranasal malignancies and their proportion?",
      sample_answer: "Approximately half of paranasal malignancies are Squamous Cell Carcinomas (SCC), followed by adenoid cystic carcinomas, adenocarcinomas, and mucoepidermoid carcinomas. The maxillary sinus is the most commonly involved site, followed by the ethmoid sinus.",
    },
    {
      question: "Describe the staging of paranasal sinus cancer.",
      sample_answer: "The T staging differs for Maxillary Sinus and Ethmoid sinus ones. For maxillary sinuses T1: Tumor confined to the mucosa with no erosion or destruction of bone. T2: Tumor causing bone erosion or destruction, including extension into the hard palate and/or middle nasal meatus, except extension to the posterior wall of maxillary sinus and pterygoid plates. T3: Tumor invades any of the following: bone of the posterior wall of maxillary sinus, subcutaneous tissues, floor or medial wall of orbit, pterygoid fossa, or ethmoid sinuses. T4a: Tumor invades any of the following: anterior orbital contents, skin of cheek, pterygoid plates, infratemporal fossa, cribriform plate, and sphenoid or frontal sinuses. T4b: Tumor invades any of the following: orbital apex, dura, brain, middle cranial fossa, cranial nerves other than maxillary division of trigeminal nerve (V2), nasopharynx, or clivus. For Ethmoid Sinus: T1: Tumor restricted to one sub-site of nasal cavity or ethmoid sinus, with or without bony invasion. T2: Tumor involves two sub-sites in a single site or extends to involve an adjacent site within the nasoethmoidal complex, with or without bony invasion. T3: Tumor extends to invade the medial wall or floor of the orbit, maxillary sinus, palate, or cribriform plate. T4a: Tumor invades any of the following: anterior orbital contents, skin of nose or cheek, minimal extension to anterior cranial fossa, pterygoid plates, and sphenoid or frontal sinuses. T4b: Tumor invades any of the following: orbital apex, dura, brain, middle cranial fossa, cranial nerves other than V2, nasopharynx, or clivus.",

      question: "Which lymph nodes will a paranasal sinus malignancy metastasise to first?",
      sample_answer: "Paranasal sinus malignancies first metastasize to the retropharyngeal nodes, followed by periparotid, level 1B, and level 2 nodes.",

    {
      question: "What is Ohngren's line and what is its significance?",
      sample_answer: "Ohngren's line is an imaginary line drawn from the medial canthus to the angle of the mandible. Tumors located superior to this line tend to have a poorer prognosis due to the likelihood of advanced disease and involvement of critical structures, which complicates treatment and decreases survival rates.",
    },
    {
      question: "The histology comes back as squamous cell carcinoma of the ethmoid and maxillary sinuses. What are the treatment options for paranasal sinus SCC?",
      sample_answer: "For SCC of the ethmoid and maxillary sinuses, treatment options are multidisciplinary, involving surgery, radiation therapy, and possibly chemotherapy. Surgery aims to completely remove the tumor and may involve procedures like endoscopic resection for less advanced cases, or open approaches such as Caldwell-Luc, lateral rhinotomy, or craniofacial resection for more extensive disease. Postoperative radiation therapy is typically recommended to eliminate microscopic residual disease and improve local control, especially in cases with positive margins or advanced T stage. Concurrent chemoradiation may be considered for locally advanced disease, particularly when surgery is not feasible or as an adjunct to surgery in cases with high-risk features. Palliative care is an option for unresectable or metastatic disease to manage symptoms and improve quality of life.",
    },
    {
      question: "Discuss the surgical approaches to treatment for paranasal sinus SCC.",
      sample_answer: "Surgical approaches for the treatment of paranasal sinus SCC vary based on the tumor's location, size, and extent of invasion into surrounding structures. Endoscopic surgery is preferred for early-stage tumors due to its minimally invasive nature, which allows for better visualization and preservation of important anatomical structures. For more advanced tumors, open surgical approaches may be necessary. These can include: Caldwell-Luc approach, primarily for access to the maxillary sinus. Lateral rhinotomy, providing access to the nasal cavity and the maxillary, ethmoid, and sphenoid sinuses. Midfacial degloving, which offers wide exposure for tumors in the nasal cavity and maxillary sinus without external incisions. Craniofacial resection, indicated for tumors that invade the anterior skull base or extend beyond the sinuses into the cranial cavity. This approach may also involve orbital exenteration if the tumor invades the orbit. The choice of surgical approach depends on achieving the best possible oncologic outcome while preserving function and appearance. Multidisciplinary evaluation is crucial to tailor the surgical plan to each patient's specific situation.",

      question: "What is a SNUC and how might it present differently from other paranasal sinus malignancies?",
      sample_answer: "Sinonasal Undifferentiated Carcinoma (SNUC) is a highly aggressive and poorly differentiated malignancy originating from the mucosa of the nasal cavity or paranasal sinuses. It differs in its rapid progression, extensive tissue destruction at presentation, and poor prognosis. SNUC often presents with advanced disease, showing extensive local invasion and a higher likelihood of distant metastases compared to other sinonasal malignancies.",
