      question:
        "You are called to the pediatric emergency department to see a 1-year-old with a sudden change in her breathing and significant respiratory distress. What would be your approach to management?",
      sample_answer:
        "I would approach the child using the Airway, Breathing, Circulation, Disability, Exposure (ABCDE) framework of the Advanced Pediatric Life Support (APLS), whilst keeping them and their family calm and reassured. For Airway, I would assess for airway patency by looking for signs of airway obstruction, such as stridor or stertor and drooling, whilst providing high-flow oxygen to the child. For Breathing, I would assess the breathing pattern, effort, and oxygen saturation, looking for tachypnea, nasal flaring, cyanosis, tracheal tug, subcostal, intercostal, and sternal recessions. I would listen for abnormal breath sounds like wheezing or decreased breath sounds that may indicate a foreign body obstruction. In terms of Circulation, I would evaluate heart rate, color, and capillary refill time. For Disability, I would quickly assess the child's level of consciousness using the AVPU scale (Alert, Voice responsive, Pain responsive, Unresponsive) and check for any neurological signs indicating a more severe condition. Exposure would involve checking for any other injuries or signs that might indicate the cause of distress, ensuring to keep them warm to prevent hypothermia.",

      question: "What would you ask in the history?",
      sample_answer:
        "In the history, it's essential to gather information that could indicate the cause of the respiratory distress and guide management. Key questions include: Onset and nature of the current episode: Was the onset sudden? Did it occur during play, eating, or after a fall? Presence of a choking episode: Was there any witnessed choking or coughing episode? Recent illnesses: Has the child had any recent upper respiratory tract infections, symptoms of cough, cold, or fever? Previous similar episodes: Has the child experienced any similar episodes in the past? Foreign body ingestion: Could the child have had access to small objects, food items known to pose a risk of aspiration (like peanuts), or batteries? Medical history: Any known medical conditions, allergies, previous surgeries or hospital admissions? Family history: Is there a history of asthma or other respiratory conditions in the family?",

      question:
        "The history is of a child who was playing, and suddenly started coughing and then developed noisy breathing which has now settled. What examination findings would you expect if the child had aspirated a foreign body?",
      sample_answer:
        "Examination findings in a child suspected of having aspirated a foreign body typically include: General distress or agitation: Indicative of discomfort or difficulty breathing. Abnormal breathing sounds: Including stridor (if the foreign body is in the larynx or trachea), wheezing (particularly if unilateral and indicating bronchial obstruction), or decreased breath sounds on the affected side (suggesting complete obstruction). Respiratory distress signs: Such as nasal flaring, use of accessory muscles, and retractions (intercostal, subcostal, supraclavicular). Cyanosis: Indicating severe hypoxia. Cough: Persistent cough that may be present if the foreign body is causing irritation.",

    {
      question: "What investigations, if any, would you perform?",
      sample_answer:
        "Investigations in the context of suspected foreign body aspiration include: Chest X-ray: To identify radio-opaque objects and evaluate for signs of airway obstruction such as localized hyperinflation or atelectasis. Lateral neck X-ray: May be helpful in identifying foreign bodies in the upper airway.",
    },
    {
      question: "What findings on CXR would suggest an airway foreign body?",
      sample_answer:
        "Findings on Chest X-ray (CXR) suggestive of an airway foreign body include: Direct visualization of a radio-opaque object within the airway. Evidence of air trapping in one lung or a lung segment, seen as hyperinflation on the affected side due to a ball-valve effect caused by the foreign body. Atelectasis: Collapse of a lung segment distal to the obstruction. Mediastinal shift: Away from the side of obstruction in case of significant air trapping, or towards the obstruction if atelectasis is present.",

      question:
        "How would you manage this case if it were of a peanut in the right main bronchus and the patient is presenting with desaturations?",
      sample_answer:
        "My approach would include: Preoperative planning by ensuring we have the senior most available pediatric anesthetist and make a comprehensive airway plan to perform rigid bronchoscopy and foreign body removal. Pre-Operative Preparation: Ensuring the child is stable with supplemental oxygen to improve oxygen saturation. Preparing for potential complications, including gathering all necessary equipment for airway management and foreign body retrieval and assembling the rigid bronchoscope. Induction of anesthesia with maintenance of spontaneous ventilation is preferred to assess the stability of the airway. Topical anesthesia to the vocal cords and airway might be applied to minimize irritation and coughing. A rigid bronchoscopy under general anesthesia is the standard approach for removal of a bronchial foreign body. The bronchoscope is passed during laryngoscopy and allows direct visualization of the airway while providing a means to ventilate the patient during the procedure. The childâ€™s airway should be shared effectively with the anesthesiologist, ensuring good communication throughout the procedure. Once the foreign body is visualized, appropriate grasping forceps are used to securely grasp and remove the peanut from the right main bronchus. Care must be taken to avoid pushing the object further into the bronchial tree or causing trauma to the airway mucosa. Close monitoring should happen in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) for signs of respiratory distress, oxygen desaturations, or complications. A post-operative chest X-ray may be performed to confirm the removal of the foreign body and assess for any complications such as pneumothorax. We would then Monitor for any signs of airway injury or complications in the days following the procedure. Antibiotics and corticosteroids may be considered based on the degree of airway trauma and inflammation observed during the procedure.",

      question:
        "Final question: What if it was 10pm and the patient was clinically stable?",
      sample_answer:
        "If the child is clinically stable without signs of severe respiratory distress, hypoxia, or other life-threatening conditions, and the foreign body does not pose an immediate risk (e.g., not causing significant obstruction or located in a less critical part of the airway), it may be reasonable to delay the bronchoscopy to the next available daytime slot when the full surgical and anesthetic team is readily available, and the child can be managed in an optimal setting. However, this decision must be made cautiously, considering the following: Continuous Monitoring: The child should be admitted to a unit where continuous respiratory monitoring can be ensured, and where quick intervention is possible if the child's condition deteriorates. Oxygen Support: Provide supplemental oxygen as needed to maintain satisfactory oxygen saturation levels. NPO Status: The child should remain NPO (nothing by mouth) to prepare for potential emergency anesthesia and surgery. Immediate Availability of Surgical and Anesthetic Teams: Ensure that both surgical and anesthetic teams are aware of the situation and can be mobilized quickly if the child's condition changes.",
