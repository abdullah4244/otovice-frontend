      question: "What is your differential diagnosis for this patient?",
      sample_answer: "My differential diagnoses would include congenital causes, such as a thyroglossal duct cyst or dermoid cyst, both of which can become infected. Acquired conditions such as a branchial arch anomaly or lymphadenopathy, which can also become infected. I would also consider neoplasms, with benign neoplasms such as a thyroid nodule or plunging a ranula and malignant neoplasms such as lymphoma, neuropblastoma, thyroid cancer and rhabdomyosarcoma. Lastly, I would consider vascular anomalies, including lymphatic, venous and AVMs, though not typically midline.",
    },
    {
      question: "Would you ask during your history for this patient?",
      sample_answer: "I would ask about the length of time the lump has been present, any increase in size, and if there have been any infections. It's important to inquire about symptoms of extrinsic compression like dysphagia, dysphonia, or dyspnoea, as these can indicate the mass's effect on surrounding structures. I'd also gather a detailed past medical history, particularly of congenital anomalies, and a family history of thyroid disease.",
    },
    {
      question: "What would you look for during your examination of this patient?",
      sample_answer: "During my examination, I would specifically look for the location and characteristics of the lump—whether it is midline or off-center, its mobility with swallowing or tongue protrusion (suggestive of a thyroglossal duct cyst), tenderness (suggesting inflammation or infection), and the texture (cystic versus solid). I would also check for skin changes over the lump, assess for any other neck lumps, and evaluate for congenital abnormalities in the head and neck area. These findings can help narrow down the differential diagnosis and guide further investigation.",
    },
    {
      question: "What investigations would you undertake for this patient?",
      sample_answer: "I would start with an ultrasound scan to assess the lesion's cystic or solid nature and to confirm the presence of a normal thyroid gland elsewhere. Scintigraphy might be considered if there are concerns about the absence of functional thyroid tissue or if the thyroglossal duct cyst might contain the only functional thyroid tissue. Thyroid function tests (TFTs) could also be informative, especially if there's a suspicion of thyroid dysfunction.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is a thyroglossal duct cyst?",
      sample_answer: "A thyroglossal duct cyst is a congenital neck mass that arises from the failure of the thyroglossal duct to obliterate during embryologic development. The thyroid gland originates from the foramen cecum at the base of the tongue and descends through the neck, usually passing anterior to the hyoid bone, to reach its final pretracheal position. If this duct, which forms as the gland descends, does not completely close, remnants can form a cyst. These cysts are lined by respiratory and squamous epithelium and can contain thyroid follicles and colloid. They typically present as a midline neck swelling and can move with swallowing or tongue protrusion due to their attachment to the hyoid bone.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do you treat an acutely infected thyroglossal duct cyst?",
      sample_answer: "An acutely infected thyroglossal duct cyst should be treated with antibiotics targeting common pathogens such as Staphylococcus and Streptococcus species. Aspiration can be considered if the cyst does not respond to antibiotics alone. However, incision and drainage should be avoided when possible to prevent the creation of a chronic sinus or fistula. Surgical excision, typically through the Sistrunk procedure, may be planned once the acute infection has resolved.",
    },
    {
      question: "Where can thyroglossal duct cysts present?",
      sample_answer: "Thyroglossal duct cysts most commonly present in the midline of the neck (90%), with a smaller percentage presenting to the left (9%) or right (1%). About 75% of these cysts are located infra-hyoid. They can present anywhere along the path of the thyroid gland's descent from the foramen cecum to the lower neck, including lingual thyroglossal duct cysts at the base of the tongue.",
    },
    {
      question: "Tell me about lingual thyroids",
      sample_answer: "Lingual thyroids result from the failure of the thyroid gland to descend from the foramen cecum. They present as a mass at the base of the tongue, often in females, and can cause symptoms like dysphagia, dysphonia, or stertor, especially if they grow large. In 75% of cases, this is the only functioning thyroid tissue. Investigations include CT or neck ultrasound to identify caudal thyroid tissue, thyroid function tests to assess for hypothyroidism, and possibly a technetium scan to confirm the presence of functioning thyroid tissue. Treatment might be observation for asymptomatic cases or surgery for symptomatic cases, potentially requiring thyroid hormone supplementation or suppression.",

      question: "What is the risk of malignancy with a thyroglossal duct cyst?",
      sample_answer: "The risk of malignancy in thyroglossal duct cysts is low, with literature suggesting less than 1-3%. The most common type of malignancy associated with these cysts is papillary carcinoma, followed by squamous cell carcinoma.",

      question: "What would you tell the parents of a child undergoing TGDC surgery during the consent process?",
      sample_answer: "I would explain both the benefits and the risks involved in the procedure. The benefits include the removal of the cyst to prevent future infections, discomfort, and the very small but significant risk of malignancy within the cyst. It’s also important to stress that the Sistrunk procedure has a high success rate in preventing recurrence of the cyst. For the risks, I would detail: General Surgical Risks: These include infection at the incision site, bleeding, and reactions to anesthesia. There's also the standard risk of pain and scarring at the site of surgery. Specific Risks: The modified Sistrunk procedure involves more than just removing the cyst; it includes removal of part of the hyoid bone and a core of tissue that may extend to the base of the tongue. With this in mind, specific risks include: Injury to Nearby Structures: There’s a risk of damaging structures adjacent to the surgical site. This includes the possibility of injuring nerves such as the hypoglossal nerve, which controls tongue movements, and the lingual nerve, affecting sensation in the tongue and taste and the superior laryngeal nerve which controls voice pitch and laryngeal sensation. Injury to the Thyroid Gland or Its Function: Given the proximity to the thyroid, there's a risk, albeit low, of affecting thyroid function. Recurrence: Despite the high success rate of the Sistrunk procedure, there's a small chance that the cyst could recur, necessitating further surgery. Airway Compromise: Although rare, postoperative swelling could potentially affect the airway, necessitating close monitoring after the procedure.",

      question: "Outline the steps involved in the modified Sistrunk procedure.",
      sample_answer: "The patient is placed under general anesthesia. A neck roll is used to extend the neck, improving access to the surgical site. A horizontal incision is made at the skin crease level, ideally placed to ensure cosmetic acceptability, directly over the lump if the skin is healthy, or encompassing any scarred tissue or fistula. Dissection proceeds to carefully expose the cyst. The aim is to preserve the cyst intact to avoid spillage of contents which could increase the risk of recurrence. A crucial part of the procedure involves identifying the hyoid bone. The central or middle third of the hyoid bone is dissected free and prepared for resection. This step is essential as the thyroglossal tract often runs in close relation to, or even through, the hyoid bone. The thyroglossal tract, extending from the cyst up towards the foramen cecum at the tongue base, is traced and carefully excised. This involves dissecting the tract through the muscular and soft tissue layers, ensuring a wide margin to include potential arborizations of the tract. The cyst and the tract, along with the central section of the hyoid bone, are removed in one continuous piece. This en bloc resection minimizes the chance of leaving behind any remnants that could lead to recurrence. The dissection is extended to include a small core of tissue up to the base of the tongue. This is critical as the original thyroglossal duct extends to this area, and its complete removal is necessary to prevent recurrence. The surgical site is closed in layers. This typically involves reapproximating the strap muscles, if they were dissected, and closing the platysma and skin. A drain may be inserted to manage postoperative oozing and reduce the risk of hematoma formation.",

      question: "What are the options if you do not have imaging showing the presence of a thyroid gland ahead of surgery",
      sample_answer: "If preoperative imaging does not confirm the presence of a normal thyroid gland, we might proceed with scintigraphy to identify functioning thyroid tissue elsewhere in the neck or body. In the absence of identifiable thyroid tissue, or if there's concern during surgery about the absence of a normal thyroid gland, an on-table ultrasound could be considered. If still unresolved, exploring the neck during surgery to confirm the presence of thyroid tissue might be necessary. In such cases, careful planning and coordination with endocrinology and radiology are crucial to ensure the patient's safety and appropriate post-operative management.",

    {
      question: "How would you treat a lingual thyroid causing airway symptoms?",
      sample_answer: "Treating a lingual thyroid with airway symptoms involves a careful, multidisciplinary approach: Initial Assessment would involved Thyroid Function Tests (TFTs) to Determine thyroid hormone levels. Imaging: in the form of Ultrasound, CT/MRI for size and extent, and scintigraphy to identify functional thyroid tissue. Medical Management would be in the form of Thyroid Hormone Suppression Therapy i.e. Administering levothyroxine to potentially reduce the lingual thyroid size. Or Thyroid Hormone Replacement For hypothyroid patients. In terms of surgical management, Surgical intervention may be considered if there is significant airway obstruction, dysphagia, dysphonia, or if there's a suspicion of malignancy. The decision for surgery also depends on the lingual thyroid's size and the presence or absence of ectopic thyroid tissue elsewhere. Depending on the lingual thyroid's size and location, options may include transoral robotic surgery (TORS), lip split mandibulotomy, transoral laser microsurgery, or a transcervical approach for larger lesions. The choice of technique depends on the mass's accessibility and the surgeon's expertise. If the lingual thyroid is the only source of thyroid hormone, part of the tissue may be preserved or re-implanted into the neck muscles to maintain thyroid function. Radioactive iodine therapy may be Considered in older patients or those with contraindications to surgery. It aims to reduce the size of the lingual thyroid by ablating the thyroid tissue. Post treatment follow up requires regular TFTs to monitor and adjust thyroid hormone therapy as needed and consideration of imaging if there is residual lingual thyroid tissue, in order to assess for any regrowth or development of malignancy.",
