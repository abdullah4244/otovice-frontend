      question: "What is your differential diagnosis for a patient with facial pain?",
      sample_answer: "Neurological Causes: Trigeminal Neuralgia: Characterized by sharp, electric-shock-like pain in the distributions of the trigeminal nerve, often triggered by light touch. Trigeminal Autonomic Cephalgias: Includes cluster headaches and other conditions causing intense, unilateral pain with autonomic symptoms. Vascular Causes: Migraines: Known for throbbing, unilateral pain, sensitivity to light and sound, and sometimes visual aura. Giant Cell Arteritis: In older patients, can cause significant pain with systemic symptoms, and requires immediate treatment to prevent complications like vision loss. Musculoskeletal Causes: Temporomandibular Joint (TMJ) Dysfunction: Presents with pain and dysfunction in the jaw joint and muscles, often exacerbated by jaw movements. Myofascial Pain Syndrome: Involves trigger points in facial muscles that produce referred pain. Sinonasal Causes: Chronic Sinusitis: Persistent inflammation of the sinuses that can cause a deep, constant pain over the affected area. Septal Perforations: Can lead to discomfort and recurrent nasal infections, contributing to facial pain. Infectious Causes: Herpes Zoster (Shingles): Reactivation of varicella-zoster virus in nerve tissues, leading to painful rash along affected nerves. Neoplastic Causes: Consider secondary headaches from brain tumors or metastatic cancer, especially if there are neurological deficits or changes in headache pattern. Psychiatric and Idiopathic Causes: Atypical Facial Pain: Often chronic and poorly defined with significant psychological overtones, a diagnosis of exclusion.",

      question: "What would you inquire about during your history taking for this patient?",
      sample_answer: "Effective history taking for facial pain involves exploring various aspects to pinpoint the underlying cause: Pain Characteristics (SOCRATES): I would ask about the site, onset, character, radiation, association, timing, exacerbating factors, and severity of the pain to distinguish between types like neuralgic pain and vascular headache. Autonomic Symptoms: Important in diagnosing trigeminal autonomic cephalgias, such as cluster headaches, which include features like tearing, nasal congestion, and ptosis. Nasal Symptoms: Inquiries about congestion, discharge, and sinus pressure help identify sinusitis or other nasal pathologies. TMJ and Dental Health: Asking about jaw pain, clicking sounds, recent dental procedures, and oral health can reveal TMJ disorders or dental issues causing facial pain. Previous Treatments and Responses: Information on what medications or therapies have been tried and their outcomes can guide further diagnostic and treatment plans. Personal and Family Medical History: Includes questions on past health issues, especially neurological or autoimmune disorders, and any family history of similar symptoms.",

    {
      question: "What would you look for during your examination of this patient?",
      sample_answer: "A thorough physical examination should cover: Facial and Head Inspection: Look for asymmetry, swelling, or abnormal movements. Palpate the sinus areas, TMJ, and facial muscles for tenderness or abnormalities. Neurological Examination: Focused on cranial nerves, especially the trigeminal nerve for sensory deficits or hypersensitivity and facial nerve for motor function. Nasal and Oral Examination: Assess for structural abnormalities, signs of infection, and the health of the oral cavity and teeth. Autonomic Signs: Particularly important in cases of trigeminal autonomic cephalgias, check for lacrimation, nasal congestion, or eyelid edema.",
    },
    {
      question: "What investigations would you undertake for this patient?",
      sample_answer: "The choice of investigations depends on the suspected underlying cause: MRI of the Brain and Facial Structures: Essential for evaluating trigeminal neuralgia, suspected tumors, or vascular malformations. CT Scan of the Sinuses: Useful in cases where sinusitis or other sinus pathologies are suspected. Dental X-rays or Panoramic Radiographs (OPG): To detect dental abscesses, impacted teeth, or other dental issues that could cause facial pain. Blood Tests: Such as ESR and CRP to rule out systemic conditions like giant cell arteritis.",

      question: "What are the diagnostic criteria for a migraine according to the international classification for headache disorders?",
      sample_answer: "The International Headache Society's criteria for diagnosing migraine without aura include: At least five attacks fulfilling the following features: Headache lasting 4 to 72 hours (if untreated). Headache has at least two of the following characteristics: unilateral location, pulsating quality, moderate to severe intensity, aggravated by routine physical activity. During the headache, there is either nausea and/or vomiting, or photophobia and phonophobia. Not attributed to another disorder.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do you treat migraine?",
      sample_answer: "The treatment of migraine involves both acute symptomatic relief and preventive strategies: Acute Treatment: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and triptans are the mainstays for symptomatic relief during migraine attacks. Antiemetics may also be used to manage nausea and vomiting associated with migraines. Preventive Treatment: This may include beta-blockers (e.g., propranolol), calcium channel blockers (e.g., verapamil), antiepileptic drugs (e.g., topiramate), and CGRP (calcitonin gene-related peptide) antagonists. Lifestyle modifications, such as regular sleep schedules, hydration, stress management, and avoidance of known triggers (e.g., certain foods, caffeine, and alcohol), are crucial. In refractory cases, Botox injections may be considered.",

      question: "What is trigeminal neuralgia?",
      sample_answer: "Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is a chronic pain condition that affects the trigeminal nerve, which is one of the most widely distributed nerves in the head. The condition is characterized by intense, brief, episodic bursts of pain in the areas supplied by the trigeminal nerve, typically felt as sharp, shooting, or like an electric shock. These episodes can be triggered by everyday activities such as eating, talking, or even touching the face. The pain is typically unilateral and can be extremely debilitating.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do you manage trigeminal neuralgia?",
      sample_answer: "The management of trigeminal neuralgia primarily involves medication and, in refractory cases, surgical interventions: Medications: Carbamazepine is the first-line treatment and is effective in reducing or blocking pain signals in the nerve. Other anticonvulsants like oxcarbazepine, gabapentin, and baclofen may also be used. Surgical Treatments: Microvascular decompression (MVD) offers a potential cure by relieving pressure on the trigeminal nerve. Other surgical options include stereotactic radiosurgery (Gamma Knife) and rhizotomy procedures (such as glycerol injection, balloon compression, or radiofrequency thermal lesioning), which selectively damage nerve fibers that are carrying pain.",

    {
      question: "What are trigeminal autonomic cephalgias?",
      sample_answer: "Trigeminal autonomic cephalgias (TACs) are a group of primary headache disorders characterized by severe, unilateral headache attacks with accompanying autonomic symptoms on the same side of the head. These symptoms can include red or watery eyes, nasal congestion or runny nose, and drooping or swelling of the eyelid. Examples include cluster headaches, paroxysmal hemicrania, and SUNCT (short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks with conjunctival injection and tearing) or SUNA (short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks with cranial autonomic symptoms).",

    {
      question: "Tell me about cluster headaches and how you manage them.",
      sample_answer: "Cluster headaches are known for their extreme severity and occur in cyclical patterns or clusters. The pain is typically located around or behind one eye and can be accompanied by autonomic symptoms such as tearing, nasal congestion, and eyelid drooping on the same side. Acute Treatment: Inhalation of high-flow oxygen through a mask for 15-20 minutes is highly effective. Subcutaneous or intranasal administration of sumatriptan can also abort the headache. Preventive Treatment: Verapamil is commonly used to prevent cluster headache cycles. Other options may include corticosteroids or lithium, particularly if attacks are frequent and severe.",

      question: "Tell me about TMJ dysfunction and how you manage it.",
      sample_answer: "TMJ (temporomandibular joint) dysfunction involves pain and compromised movement of the jaw joint and the surrounding muscles. It can cause pain in the jaw, face, and even the neck. Management: Initial treatment typically involves conservative measures such as eating soft foods, applying ice or heat, and avoiding extreme jaw movements. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can help reduce pain and inflammation. More structured treatments include physical therapy, oral splints or mouth guards to prevent teeth grinding, and in severe cases, corticosteroid injections into the joint. Surgery is considered a last resort.",

      question: "Tell me about midfacial segment pain and how you manage it.",
      sample_answer: "Midfacial segment pain typically presents as a deep, dull, and constant pain across the midface, often mistaken for sinusitis but not responsive to typical sinus treatments. It may be associated with facial tenderness and can mimic the symptoms of chronic sinusitis. Management: Treatment usually involves the use of low-dose tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline to help modulate the pain. Education about the non-sinus origin of the pain is important for patient understanding and compliance. If conservative measures fail, further evaluation and treatments such as nerve blocks may be considered under specialist care.",
