      question: "Please describe this audiogram",
      sample_answer: "This is a pure tone audiogram showing a mixed severe to profound hearing loss on the right.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is your differential diagnosis for this audiogram?",
      sample_answer: "I would consider: Traumatic causes such as temporal bone fracture or perilymph fistula Bone diseases such as Otosclerosis with cochlear involvement Mucosal disease such as extensive cholesteatoma And Neoplasms such as jugulotympanic paraganglioma",
    },
    {
      question: "This is the audiogram of a patient in the emergency department following a road traffic accident. What would you ask during your history for this patient?",
      sample_answer: "I would ask about: Mechanism of Injury: Including the direction of impact and force. Symptoms Post-Injury and their onset, that is, delayed or immediate, Focusing on hearing loss, tinnitus, otorrhea or rhinorrhea, bleeding from the ears, vertigo, facial weakness or paralysis, changes in taste, pain, loss of consciousness and disorientation. I would also ask about Previous Hearing Status To assess for pre-existing conditions.",
    },
    {
      question: "What would you look for during your examination of this patient?",
      sample_answer: "I would perform General Examination: Assessing for other injuries & calculating their GCS. On Ear Examination I would look for Hemotympanum, discharge, perforation of the tympanic membrane, and inspection of the external auditory canal for lacerations. Neurological Examination would focus on Facial nerve function & signs of other cranial nerve involvement, as well as assessing for nystagmus and pupillary reaction. I would look for Signs of Basilar Skull Fracture: Such as Battle's sign, raccoon eyes.",
    },
    {
      question: "This patient has clear otorrhea and facial asymmetry but detailed assessment was limited due to the patient's condition. What investigations would you undertake for this patient?",
      sample_answer: "I would undertake: High-resolution CT scan of the temporal bones and head to identify the fracture lines, assess for otic capsule involvement, detect any signs of pneumolabyrinth (indicative of otic capsule involvement), evaluate the facial nerve canal, and check for intracranial complications such as hematomas or brain contusions. Beta 2 transferrin test to confirm the presence of CSF in the otorrhoea If the patient's condition allows, I would consider Electroneuronography and Electromyography at 3 to 14 days and 21 days respectively.",
    },
    {
      question: "This is the CT scan, please describe what you see.",
      sample_answer: "This is an axial view of a CT scan of the temporal bone showing an otic capsule involving transverse fracture also involving the internal auditory canal.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do you classify temporal bone trauma?",
      sample_answer: "Temporal bone fractures can be classified based on their relation to the petrous part of the temporal bone into longitudinal, transverse, and mixed fractures. Longitudinal fractures are more common and usually result from lateral impacts, potentially causing conductive hearing loss and less commonly facial nerve injury. Transverse fractures result from frontal or occipital impacts and are associated with a higher risk of sensorineural hearing loss, facial nerve injury, and CSF leaks. An alternative classification is otic capsule sparing versus otic capsule involving fractures, with the latter presenting a higher risk for severe complications including profound hearing loss, facial nerve paralysis, and CSF leaks.",

      question: "Tell me about the role of Electrophysiologic testing in such a patient.",
      sample_answer: "ENOG should be performed within 3 to 14 days post-injury to assess the extent of degeneration. This window allows for the detection of Wallerian degeneration, a process that begins approximately 72 hours after the nerve injury. ENoG measures the electrical response of the facial muscles to stimulation of the facial nerve. A reduction in response amplitude compared to the unaffected side suggests degeneration of the nerve fibers, with a reduction greater than 90% indicating a poor prognosis without surgical intervention. EMG is typically performed later in the course of evaluation, often starting at 3 weeks post-injury and can be repeated thereafter as needed. This test is more useful for detecting signs of reinnervation and recovery in the facial muscles. EMG assesses the electrical activity of muscles at rest and during voluntary movements. In the early stages after an injury, EMG can help to confirm the presence and extent of denervation. Later on, it can detect reinnervation potentials, which are indicative of nerve regeneration and recovery.",

      question: "This patient has a CSF leak, immediate facial palsy, and conductive hearing loss. How are you going to treat him?",
      sample_answer: "Immediate treatment involves: Conservative management for the CSF leak with bed rest, head elevation, and possibly a lumbar drain if the leak persists. Eye care and High-dose corticosteroids if facial nerve palsy is delayed or partial, and surgical exploration if there is complete paralysis with significant degeneration on ENoG. Conductive hearing loss due to hemotympanum may resolve spontaneously; otherwise, hearing restoration surgery may be considered once the acute phase is over. Cochlear implantation is considered for profound sensorineural hearing loss secondary to otic capsule-disrupting fractures. Prophylactic antibiotics remain controversial, but vaccination against pneumococcus, meningococcus, and Haemophilus influenzae is advised due to the increased risk of meningitis.",

      question: "The facial nerve decompression has not worked; can you discuss options for facial reanimation and their timing?",
      sample_answer: "If facial nerve decompression fails, options for facial reanimation include: Dynamic reanimation techniques such as temporalis or masseter muscle transfer, or free muscle transfer innervated by an alternative cranial nerve (masseteric or contralateral facial nerve) for more permanent solutions. These are usually considered several months after injury to allow for any potential natural recovery. Static procedures like brow lift, canthoplasty, or facial slings to improve symmetry. Cross-facial nerve grafting or hypoglossal-facial nerve anastomosis could be considered if there's no facial nerve function recovery within 6 to 12 months post-injury. For immediate palsy with no hope of nerve recovery, early intervention within the first year is crucial for optimal outcomes in dynamic reanimation.",

      question: "How do you evaluate potential vascular injuries in a patient with temporal bone trauma?",
      sample_answer: "Evaluation of potential vascular injuries in the setting of temporal bone trauma involves a careful clinical and radiologic assessment: Clinical Signs: Initial evaluation should include looking for signs of pulsatile tinnitus, bruit, active bleeding from the ear, or any neurologic symptoms suggestive of a vascular injury, such as Horner's syndrome. Imaging: CT angiography (CTA) is the primary imaging modality for assessing vascular integrity, capable of identifying dissections, transections, or pseudoaneurysms of the carotid artery and other vascular structures. MR angiography (MRA) can be used as an adjunct or alternative to CTA for further detailed evaluation.",
    },
    {
      question: "What management strategies are employed for vascular injuries associated with temporal bone trauma?",
      sample_answer: "Management of vascular injuries related to temporal bone trauma includes several steps aimed at stabilization, definitive treatment, and prevention of complications: Immediate Control: Initial management may involve packing the external auditory canal to control active bleeding temporarily. Endovascular Therapy: For carotid artery injuries, endovascular interventions like stenting or coil embolization are often preferred due to their minimally invasive nature and effectiveness. Surgical Repair: In cases where endovascular management is not possible or is unsuccessful, direct surgical repair or ligation of the vessel may be required, depending on the type and location of the injury. Neurological Monitoring: Patients with significant vascular injuries, especially to the carotid artery, may require intensive neurological monitoring and supportive care. Anticoagulation Therapy: The use of anticoagulation therapy may be considered to prevent thromboembolic events, weighing the benefits against the risk of hemorrhage.",
