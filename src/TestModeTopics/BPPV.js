      question: "What is going on in this picture?",
      sample_answer: "This is a picture of a patient undergoing a Dix-Hallpike maneuver, a diagnostic test performed by a healthcare professional. The patient is quickly moved from a sitting to a lying position, with their head turned to one side and slightly extended backward.",
    },
    {
      question: "Why would someone be undergoing this?",
      sample_answer: "This maneuver aims to reproduce vertigo symptoms and nystagmus characteristic of Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV), especially affecting the posterior semicircular canal. BPPV is a vestibular disorder that causes brief episodes of vertigo related to changes in head position, attributed to displaced otoconia within the semicircular canals (canalolithiasis) or otoconia adhered to the cupula (cupulolithiasis). These particles, normally residing in the utricle, become dislodged into the semicircular canals, most commonly the posterior canal, disrupting normal fluid movement and sending incorrect signals to the brain about head movement.",
    },
    {
      question: "What would be your expected findings for a patient with posterior canal BPPV?",
      sample_answer: "Expected findings include a transient, latency-followed geotropic rotational nystagmus with an upbeat component toward the affected ear when performing the Dix-Hallpike maneuver. Patients may also report a sensation of vertigo correlating with the nystagmus. The nystagmus and vertigo typically last less than a minute and may diminish with repeated testing due to fatigue.",
    },
    {
      question: "How would you perform an Epley Maneuver to treat this?",
      sample_answer: "To perform the Epley maneuver for posterior canal BPPV: Start with the patient sitting upright on the examination table. Perform the Dix-Hallpike maneuver to the affected side to confirm BPPV. Quickly move the patient to lie down with their head still turned to the affected side at 45 degrees, maintaining this position for about 30 seconds. Without lifting their head, turn it 90 degrees to the opposite side, wait another 30 seconds. Ask the patient to roll onto their shoulder, turning their head another 90 degrees in the same direction, looking downward, holding this position for another 30 seconds. Finally, help the patient return to a sitting position while maintaining the head rotation. This maneuver aims to guide the dislodged otoconia back to the utricle where they can no longer cause vertigo.",
    },
    {
      question: "How would you assess for lateral canal BPPV? How do you treat it?",
      sample_answer: "Lateral canal BPPV is assessed using the supine roll test or Pagnini-McClure maneuver. The patient is positioned supine, and the head is quickly turned to one side, then the other, observing for horizontal nystagmus. Treatment involves the barbecue roll or Gufoni maneuver, designed to shift the otoconia out of the lateral canal.",
    },
    {
      question: "What other treatments are available for BPPV?",
      sample_answer: "Besides the Epley and barbecue roll maneuvers, treatments include: Brandt-Daroff exercises: Habituation exercises performed at home. Semont maneuver: A rapid movement to the opposite side from the Dix-Hallpike position, for those where Epley is contraindicated or unsuccessful. Vestibular rehabilitation for persistent symptoms. Surgical options like posterior canal occlusion are rarely needed.",
    },
    {
      question: "What are the contraindications for Epley manoeuvre?",
      sample_answer: "These include, cervical spine problems such as cervical stenosis which may worsen, vascular disorders such as vertebral artery insufficiency, chiari malformation where there is a risk of increasing pressure on the cerebellum and if the patient is driving themself home, as the patient may become very dizzy.",
    },
    {
      question: "You are referred a patient with vertigo by the Emergency department. What is your differential diagnosis for a patient presenting with episodes of vertigo?",
      sample_answer: "Differential diagnoses can be categorized into peripheral and central causes: Peripheral: BPPV, Meniere's disease, vestibular neuronitis, labyrinthitis, otosclerosis. Central: Migraine-associated vertigo, multiple sclerosis, cerebrovascular disease (e.g., stroke), vestibular schwannoma. Other considerations: Metabolic disorders, cardiovascular issues, psychological factors (e.g., anxiety), and post-traumatic vertigo.",
    },
    {
      question: "How would you rule out a central cause by your examination?",
      sample_answer: "To rule out a central cause, look for signs inconsistent with peripheral vertigo, such as unsteady gait that does not improve with visual cues, direction-changing nystagmus, vertical nystagmus, focal neurological deficits (e.g., weakness, numbness), and nystagmus that does not diminish upon repeated testing. The HINTS (Head Impulse, Nystagmus, Test of Skew) examination is particularly useful for distinguishing central from peripheral causes of vertigo in acute settings.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do you perform a HINTS examination?",
      sample_answer: "In a Head Impulse Test (HIT): The patient is asked to fix their gaze on the examiner's nose. The examiner holds the patient's head and makes small, rapid, and horizontal head turns to each side. The test is positive if the patient's eyes move off target with the head turn but then quickly saccade (jump) back to target. This corrective saccade indicates a deficit in the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR), suggesting a peripheral cause. A negative test, i.e. normal, where there is no corrective saccade and the eyes stay on target during head movement, is concerning for a central cause in the context of vertigo. In testing Nystagmus I Observe the type and direction of nystagmus at rest and with gaze to either side. Peripheral nystagmus is typically unidirectional and inhibited by fixation. Central nystagmus may be bidirectional or purely vertical, and it may not decrease with fixation. Persistent nystagmus in all directions of gaze, especially purely vertical nystagmus, suggests a central cause. In a Test of Skew i.e. Skew Deviation: The patient is asked to fixate on a target. The examiner covers one eye, then quickly switches the cover to the other eye while Observing for any vertical corrective eye movement when the eye is uncovered, which suggests a vertical misalignment called skew deviation. Skew deviation is indicative of a central lesion, particularly in the brainstem or cerebellum.",

      question: "What else would you do in your examination?",
      sample_answer: "I would perform Otoscopy to Check for ear pathology. Tuning fork testing to Assess hearing function. Cranial nerve examination to Look for deficits. And perform the Romberg and Unterberger's tests to Assess balance and vestibular function.",
    },
    {
      question: "You have ruled out a central cause. What initial investigations could you undertake for this patient?",
      sample_answer: "Pure Tone Audiometry and Tympanometry to Assess hearing function and middle ear pressure. Normal results are expected in BPPV while hearing loss may suggest Meniere's disease or labyrinthitis. Vestibular Function Tests such as Caloric testing, VNG (videonystagmography), or vHIT (video head impulse test) are useful to assess semicircular canal function. Reduced vestibular response on the affected side is seen in vestibular neuronitis. Blood Tests may identify an underlying conditions like vitamin D deficiency. I would consider MRI To rule out central pathology in cases of atypical findings or persistent symptoms.",

    {
      question: "You suspect PPPD, what is it and how would you manage it?",
      sample_answer: "Persistent Postural-Perceptual Dizziness (PPPD) is a functional vestibular disorder characterized by chronic, non-vertiginous dizziness and unsteadiness, exacerbated by posture changes, movement, and complex visual stimuli. It often follows an event that initially triggered vertigo. Management includes patient education, vestibular rehabilitation, cognitive-behavioral therapy, and possibly medications like SSRIs or SNRIs to manage associated anxiety and depression.",
