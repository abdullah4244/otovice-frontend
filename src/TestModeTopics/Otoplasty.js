    {
      question: "What are the common auricular defects?",
      sample_answer: "Common auricular defects include: Protruding Ear: Characterized by an auriculocephalic angle >40°, usually due to underdevelopment of the antihelical fold or overgrowth of the conchal cartilage. Cryptotia: Also known as pocket ear deformity, where the upper auricle is buried underneath mastoid skin. Cup Ear Deformity which Involves constriction of the helix and scapha. Preauricular Lesions: Such as pits, cysts, or sinus tracts. And Lobule Deformities which can come in various configurations.",

    {
      question: "What would you inquire about during your history taking for a patient presenting for otoplasty assessment?",
      sample_answer: "I would ask about: Birth history and early development, to identify if the auricular malformation was noted at birth, which could suggest a congenital cause. Family history of similar conditions, to understand if there's a genetic component. Social and emotional development, especially in older children, to assess the psychosocial impact of the auricular deformity, such as bullying, self-esteem issues, and social anxiety. Understanding the patient's emotional well-being is crucial for holistic care. Medical history, including any known syndromic or genetic disorders, as well as any hearing issues, since auricular malformations can be associated with auditory canal or middle ear structures abnormalities. Parental concerns and patient's awareness of their condition, as often, parents might notice and be concerned about the condition before the child is aware of it.",

    {
      question: "What would you look for during your examination for a patient presenting for otoplasty assessment?",
      sample_answer: "During the examination, I would: Determine the auriculocephalic angle, and the distance of the helical rim to mastoid skin, in order to assess auricular protrusion. Evaluate the slope of the ear and measure its vertical height. Examine the auricular components including the helix, antihelix, scaphoid fossa, fossa triangularis, cymba concha, cavum concha, tragus, antitragus, and lobule. Compare the ear to the opposite side for symmetry. Look for other associated defects, such as branchial arch deformities, vertebral anomalies, and cleft palate.",
    },
    {
      question: "Would you perform any investigations?",
      sample_answer: "I would consider pure tone audiograms if there is any hearing loss. A high resolution CT of the temporal bone may be useful in cases of microtia or anotia.",

    {
      question: "How do you define prominauris?",
      sample_answer: "Prominauris is defined by an increased auriculocephalic angle of greater than 40 degrees, indicating an abnormal protrusion of the ear from the skull. It's typically caused by underdevelopment of the antihelical fold or overdevelopment of the conchal bowl.",

    {
      question: "How would you manage an infant with prominauris? What are your options?",
      sample_answer: "For an infant with prominauris, non-surgical options like ear molding are highly effective within the first 1-2 months of life due to the malleability of the cartilage. Options include the EarWell infant cradle or EarBuddies, which can remold the ear's shape non-invasively. Beyond this period, observation is recommended until the child is around 5 to 6 years old, when surgical correction may be considered.",
    },
    {
      question: "Why would you wait until the child is 5 or 6 years old to correct the abnormality?",
      sample_answer: "At this age, the ear has reached approximately 85% of its adult size, and the cartilage is still malleable enough for effective reshaping. Additionally, this timing is optimal for addressing any psychosocial impact, such as bullying or self-esteem issues, as the child begins school.",
    },
    {
      question: "What are your options for managing a child with prominauris?",
      sample_answer: "Options include Conservative management, such as observation, taping the ears, or psychotherapy, to address any psychological impact. and Surgical correction using techniques tailored to the specific anatomical issues presented by the child's ears.",
    },
    {
      question: "What are the surgical techniques for otoplasty?",
      sample_answer: "Surgical techniques for otoplasty can be categorized into cartilage sculpting techniques, suture techniques, and mixed techniques: Cartilage Sculpting Techniques include the Farrior and Chongchet techniques. These involve altering the cartilage's intrinsic shape through methods such as scoring, thinning, or splitting the cartilage. The goal is to weaken the cartilage surface to allow it to bend and form a more natural-looking antihelical fold or to reduce the conchal bowl's prominence. Suture Techniques involve using stitches to mold and reshape the ear cartilage without removing tissue. The Mustardé technique is a prime example, wherein horizontal mattress sutures are placed to accentuate the antihelical fold, thus reducing the ear's protrusion by folding the cartilage inward. Another example is the Furnas technique, where the conchal cartilage is sutured to the mastoid periosteum, reducing the auriculocephalic angle by physically pulling the concha closer to the head. Mixed Techniques combine elements of both cartilage sculpting and suture techniques to address more complex deformities or to achieve more refined aesthetic results. The Farrior technique is an example, where cartilage is both sculpted and sutured to form the antihelical fold and adjust the ear's projection. This approach often provides a comprehensive solution for a variety of ear shapes and sizes.",

    {
      question: "Describe the Mustardé technique.",
      sample_answer: "The Mustardé technique is a suture technique primarily focused on correcting the absence or underdevelopment of the antihelical fold, which is a common cause of ear protrusion. This method involves placing several horizontal mattress sutures through the posterior surface of the ear, specifically targeting the cartilage to recreate or enhance the antihelical fold. These sutures are typically placed from the scaphoid fossa across to the desired location of the antihelical fold, effectively folding the cartilage inwards to reduce the auriculocephalic angle. The sutures used are usually non-absorbable to maintain the correction long-term.",
    },
    {
      question: "Describe the Furnas technique.",
      sample_answer: "The Furnas technique, also known as the conchomastoid suture technique, addresses prominent ears by focusing on the excessive protrusion of the conchal cartilage. In this procedure, permanent sutures are used to anchor the conchal cartilage directly to the periosteum of the mastoid bone. This effectively reduces the conchomastoid angle and pulls the entire ear closer to the head, thus decreasing the ear's protrusion. The Furnas technique is particularly useful for ears where the primary issue is an overly prominent conchal bowl contributing to the appearance of protruding ears.",

      question: "What are the complications of Otoplasty?",
      sample_answer: "Complications of otoplasty can be classified into early and late postoperative periods: Early Complications include Hematoma, Infection (Including perichondritis) and Cartilage Necrosis due to inadequate blood supply, possibly resulting from overly aggressive surgical technique or infection. Late Complications are Irregular Scarring: Including hypertrophic scars or keloids, particularly in patients predisposed to such scarring. Hypoesthesia which can be temporary or permanent. Unsatisfactory Aesthetic Results: Such as asymmetry between the ears, overcorrection or undercorrection of the initial deformity, and the development of unnatural contours or folds. Telephone Ear Deformity or reverse telephone ear deformity.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is a Telephone Ear Deformity?",
      sample_answer: "Telephone Ear Deformity occurs when the upper and lower poles of the auricle protrude more than the middle, creating an appearance reminiscent of an old-fashioned telephone. This can result from overcorrection of the middle third of the auricle, improper placement of mattress sutures, or excessive postauricular skin excision. Treatment typically involves revision surgery, such as suturing the root of the helix to the temporal fascia and possibly adding a graft between the concha and mastoid.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is a reverse telephone ear deformity?",
      sample_answer: "Reverse Telephone Ear Deformity is characterized by undercorrection of the middle third of the ear or overcorrection of the superior pole and lobule, leading to an abnormal silhouette where the middle section of the ear protrudes less than the top and bottom. Treatment may require revision surgery to adjust the correction levels and achieve a more natural ear contour.",
    },
    {
      question: "Describe the ideal aesthetic outcome of otoplasty as popularized by McDowell.",
      sample_answer: "The ideal aesthetic outcome of otoplasty, as popularized by McDowell, involves creating ears that appear natural, with appropriate contours and projection. This includes: Correction of all upper third ear protrusion. Visibility of the helix beyond the antihelix from the front view. A smooth and regular helical contour. Preservation of the postauricular sulcus without significant distortion. Helix to mastoid distance within the normal range across different ear sections. And Symmetry between the two ears with lateral ear border positions matching within 3 mm.",
