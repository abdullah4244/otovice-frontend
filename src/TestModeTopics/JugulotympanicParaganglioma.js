      question: "Please describe this image",
      sample_answer: "This is an otoendoscopic image of a right ear showing a red lesion behind the inferior portion of the tympanic membrane.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is your differential diagnosis for this picture?",
      sample_answer: "My differential diagnosis includes: local diseases such as haemotympanum and Schwartze sign in active otosclerosis, vascular abnormalities such as a high riding jugular bulb, persistent stapedial artery and aberrant carotid artery, and, tumours such as jugulotympanic paraganglioma.",
    },
    {
      question: "What would you ask during your history for this patient?",
      sample_answer: "I would ask about: Local symptoms such as hearing loss, pulsatile tinnitus, and vertigo. Symptoms related to cranial nerve involvement such as dysphonia, dysphagia, tongue weakness, change in taste and facial weakness. Symptoms related to catecholamine secretion such as flushing. And personal and family history of genetic syndromes and tumours.",
    },
    {
      question: "What would you look for during your examination of this patient?",
      sample_answer: "I would assess for signs of catecholamine secretion such as hypertension, perform pneumatic otoscopy to assess for Brown's Sign, perform a cranial nerve examination, especially looking for deficits in nerves 7, 9, 10, 11 and 12, and flexible nasolaryngoscopy to assess for vocal cord movement. I would perform tuning fork tests to assess for conductive hearing loss.",
    },
    {
      question: "This patient has presented with Pulsatile tinnitus and hearing loss. Your examination is positive for Brown's sign and tuning fork testing suggests conductive hearing loss. What investigations would you undertake for this patient?",
      sample_answer: "Given my suspicion of a jugulotympanic paraganglioma, I would undertake: Micro-otoscopy and audiometric tests to characterise the hearing loss. CT of the temporal bones to look for bone erosion, evidenced by a 'moth-eaten' appearance. MRI to identify the 'salt and pepper' appearance due to flow voids from high vascularity. And Measurement of plasma and urine metanephrines to exclude secretory tumors",
    },
    {
      question: "The MRI shows a 'salt and pepper' appearance in the mass, indicative of its high vascularity, and CT imaging reveals bone erosion, consistent with a jugulotympanic paraganglioma. Urine and plasma Metanephrines are within normal ranges. Are there any additional tests or investigations that would be beneficial?",
      sample_answer: "Genetic testing for mutations in SDHB, SDHC, and SDHD could be beneficial for assessing the risk of familial paraganglioma syndromes. Whole body imaging with MRI or Gallium DOTATATE positron emission tomography CT could be considered to look for synchronous tumors.",
    },
    {
      question: "What are paragangliomas?",
      sample_answer: "Paragangliomas are tumors originating from the chromaffin cells of the autonomic nervous system, outside the adrenal medulla. The head and neck forms are carotid body tumours, jugulotympanic, vagal and Laryngeal. Head and neck paragangliomas constitute about 3% of all paragangliomas. 10% of HNPGLs produce hormones (primarily norepinephrine), around 5% are bilateral, and 5 to 10% have malignant potential. However, specific genetic mutations, particularly SDHB, are associated with a higher risk of malignancy.",
    },
    {
      question: "Describe the classification system for jugulotympanic paragangliomas.",
      sample_answer: "The Fisch classification is commonly used for jugulotympanic paragangliomas, categorizing them based on their extent: Type A: Tumor limited to the middle ear Type B: Tumor in the middle ear and mastoid without bone destruction Type C: Tumor extending into the petrous bone and possibly to the carotid canal, subdivided into C1 through C4 based on the extent of carotid involvement Type D: Tumor with intracranial extension, subdivided into D1 (extradural) and D2 (intradural)",
    },
    {
      question: "What treatment options are available for jugulotympanic paragangliomas?",
      sample_answer: "Treatment options include: Surveillance for small, asymptomatic tumors Surgical resection, which could be complete or subtotal to preserve cranial nerve function, with pre-operative embolization to reduce blood loss Radiotherapy, including stereotactic radiosurgery for small tumors or fractionated radiotherapy for larger ones, as a non-invasive option that avoids surgical risks. The choice of treatment depends on tumor size, location, patient age, comorbidities, and whether the tumor is causing symptoms or has a potential for malignancy.",
    },
    {
      question: "What are the surgical approaches for the management of jugulotympanic paragangliomas?",
      sample_answer: "Surgical approaches vary based on the tumor's classification and include: Transcanal or endaural approach for small tympanic paragangliomas (Type A) Mastoidectomy and infratemporal fossa approach for larger tumors extending into the mastoid or with infralabyrinthine involvement (Types B and C) Infratemporal fossa approach with possible neck dissection for tumors with extracranial extension Multidisciplinary skull base approaches for tumors with intracranial extension (Type D).",
    },
    {
      question: "What syndromes are associated with paragangliomas?",
      sample_answer: "Paragangliomas can be associated with several hereditary syndromes, including: Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 2. Von Hippel-Lindau. Neurofibromatosis Type 1. And Hereditary Paraganglioma-Pheochromocytoma Syndromes.",
