    {
      question: "Please describe this audiogram",
      sample_answer: "The audiogram shows profound, almost flat hearing loss in the left ear and normal hearing in the right ear. This pattern is characterized by a significant discrepancy in unmasked thresholds exceeding 40 dB between the two ears.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is your differential diagnosis for this audiogram?",
      sample_answer: "My differential diagnoses include: Non-organic hearing loss due to its characteristic flat or saucer-shaped audiogram. Organic causes of hearing loss such as sudden sensorineural hearing loss, ototoxic medication related hearing loss, trauma and meniere's disease should also be considered and ruled out through a detailed history, examination and masking of this audiogram.",
    },
    {
      question: "What you ask during your history for this patient?",
      sample_answer: "I would ask about: A Detailed history of the hearing loss including onset, duration, and any fluctuating degree. Exposure to loud noises, use of ototoxic medication, history of ear infections, trauma, or surgery to the ear. Social history focusing on any recent stresses, depression, anxiety, or changes in life circumstances. Any previous audiological evaluations or treatments undertaken for hearing issues.",
    },
    {
      question: "What would you look for during your examination of this patient?",
      sample_answer: "I would perform a full ENT examination, including Otoscopy, which I would expect to be normal in non-organic hearing loss. However, I would note Discrepancies between the patient's reported hearing loss and observed conversational hearing abilities, where the patient appears to hear better than what is suggested by the pure tone audiometry.",
    },
    {
      question: "What features of the audiogram would indicate non-organic hearing loss?",
      sample_answer: "Features indicative of non-organic hearing loss include: Test-retest variability with a difference in thresholds greater than 15 dB HL. Flat or saucer-shaped PTA curves. Absence of a shadow curve in cases of unilateral hearing loss. The patient's inability to produce occasional false-positive button presses during PTA.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is a shadow curve?",
      sample_answer: "A shadow curve is an audiometric finding seen in the audiogram of a patient with unilateral or asymmetrical hearing loss. It occurs when the test signal presented to the poorer hearing ear is actually heard by the better hearing ear due to cross-hearing, resulting in thresholds that reflect the bone-conduction levels of the better ear. The absence of a shadow curve, especially in the context of unilateral hearing loss, can be suggestive of non-organic hearing loss.",
    },
    {
      question: "What investigations would you undertake for this patient?",
      sample_answer: "Given the suspicion of nonorganic hearing loss, I would perform: Repeat PTA and tympanometry to assess for inconsistencies. Speech audiometry to compare with PTA findings. Objective tests, including otoacoustic emissions (OAEs), acoustic reflexes and ABR or CERA to evaluate cochlear function and auditory pathway integrity. I would consider Special tests such as the Stenger test for unilateral hearing loss and other behavioral tests like Lombard's and Erhardts tests to further assess the consistency and credibility of the hearing loss reported.",

      question: "What is nonorganic hearing loss?",
      sample_answer: "Nonorganic hearing loss (NOHL) refers to a condition where a person exhibits hearing loss without any physical basis to explain it, or they exaggerate the extent of their actual hearing loss. There are several motivations and psychological factors that may underlie this condition, and it's categorized into different types based on these factors: Malingering: This involves the intentional fabrication or exaggeration of symptoms for external gain, such as financial compensation, avoidance of duty, or to attain drugs. Factitious Disorder: In this case, a person intentionally produces or exaggerates symptoms of illness, including hearing loss, but the motivation is to assume the sick role rather than for any external gain. The objective is internal, seeking attention, care, or sympathy. Conversion Disorder: This condition is characterized by the presence of neurological symptoms, including hearing loss, that cannot be explained by medical or neurological conditions. The symptoms are not intentionally produced. Instead, psychological stress or conflict is thought to be converted into physical symptoms.",
    },
    {
      question: "How would you treat this patient?",
      sample_answer: "Treatment would involve a careful, non-confrontational approach that includes: Explanation and reassurance about the findings of the investigation. Offering an 'honorable escape route' by suggesting that hearing thresholds might improve with a better understanding of the test procedures and encouraging repeat testing. In cases where psychological factors are suspected, referral for psychological assessment and support may be appropriate. In some instances, providing a hearing aid might have a placebo effect or help manage any minor hearing loss present.",
    },
    {
      question: "Describe Stenger's Test",
      sample_answer: "Stenger's Test is a subjective audiometric test used primarily to detect unilateral or asymmetric non-organic (functional) hearing loss. The principle behind the test is Stenger's Principle, which states that if two sounds of different intensities but the same frequency are presented to both ears at the same time, only the louder sound will be perceived. The test utilizes this principle to identify feigned hearing loss. In practice, the test is conducted by presenting a tone at a specific frequency to both ears simultaneously. The tone is presented at a level above the threshold in the better hearing ear and below the threshold in the supposedly poorer hearing ear. If the hearing loss is genuine, the patient will respond to the tone, as they will only hear it in the better ear. However, if the hearing loss is non-organic, the patient will not respond, falsely believing that responding would indicate hearing in the 'poor' ear. Their lack of response thus indicates that the hearing loss in the poorer ear is likely feigned, as they should not hear the tone based on their claimed thresholds.",

    {
      question: "What are is masking?",
      sample_answer: "Masking involves isolating the non-test ear to prevent it from detecting the signal intended for the test ear. It is essential when there's a risk of crossover, where sound presented to the test ear is detected by the non-test side due to skull vibrations. This detection can lead to false responses, creating a shadow curve, where the thresholds identified for the test ear actually reflect responses from the non-test ear. To ensure accurate audiometric evaluation, there are three primary rules of masking that otolaryngologists and audiologists adhere to.",
    },
    {
      question: "What are the 3 rules of masking?",
      sample_answer: "Rule 1: When there is a 40 dB or greater difference between the air conduction thresholds of the two ears (or a 55 dB difference when using insert earphones), AC masking is required. This rule helps to prevent crossover by ensuring that the non-test ear is effectively isolated with narrow band noise for pure tones or pink noise for speech, allowing for accurate threshold determination of the test ear. Rule 2: Masking for bone conduction is necessary if there is a 10 dB or greater difference between the air conduction threshold in the better hearing ear and the unmasked bone conduction threshold. This rule accounts for the direct vibration of the skull by bone conduction transducers, which can easily be detected by both cochleae. Masking the non-test ear ensures that the bone conduction thresholds accurately reflect the test ear's hearing ability without interference from the non-test ear. Rule 3: This rule specifies that air conduction masking is also required if there is a 40 dB or greater difference between the air conduction threshold in the better ear and the unmasked bone conduction threshold. This situation often indicates a significant conductive component in the test ear, necessitating masking to accurately assess the sensorineural hearing threshold of the test ear by eliminating the non-test ear's response.",

      question: "What is acoustic reflex testing? How is it done?",
      sample_answer: "Acoustic reflex testing assesses the stapedius muscle's contraction in response to loud sounds. This reflex is a safeguard for the inner ear, involving a neural pathway from the cochlea, through the vestibulocochlear nerve, to the cochlear nucleus, the superior olivary complex, and finally, the facial nerve nucleus, which triggers the stapedius muscle on both sides via the facial nerve. Sounds typically 70100 dB above the pure tone threshold are used to elicit the reflex, measured either contralaterally (opposite ear) or ipsilaterally (same ear). By differentiating between crossed (sound presented to one ear, response measured in the opposite) and uncrossed (sound and response in the same ear) reflexes, we can pinpoint where along the auditory pathway there might be issues. The presence, absence, and threshold levels for reflex elicitation indicate auditory system status. Acoustic reflex decay, where the reflex's maintenance to a sustained stimulus is tested, can signal retrocochlear pathologies like tumors. Reflexes are absent in conditions such as otosclerosis, conductive hearing loss, auditory neuropathy (with present otoacoustic emissions indicating normal outer hair cell function), retrocochlear pathologies (evidenced by rollover phenomenon), and facial nerve dysfunction. Reflexes are present in superior semicircular canal dehiscence.",
