      question: "Please describe this photograph",
      sample_answer: "This is a clinical photograph of a man with a right sided facial weakness. It is House Brackmann grade 2 or 3 as he is able to close his eye.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is your differential diagnosis for this patient?",
      sample_answer: "They include: Idiopathic such as Bell's palsy, the most common cause. Infectious, for example Ramsay Hunt syndrome and Lyme disease. Congenital, for example Möbius syndrome. Neoplastic, with Benign causes such as vestibular schwannoma, facial nerve schwannoma) and malignant tumors such as parotid mucoepidermoid cancer. Traumatic, considering Fractures involving the temporal bone and iatrogenic injuries during surgery. Autoimmune causes such as Guillain-Barré syndrome, multiple sclerosis. And finally, Inflammatory causes such as Sarcoidosis, chronic otitis media with or without cholesteatoma, Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome.",
    },
    {
      question: "Would you ask during your history for this patient?",
      sample_answer: "I would ask about: Onset and progression of symptoms as Rapid onset suggests Bell's palsy or Ramsay Hunt syndrome. Recent infections as Upper respiratory infection preceding symptoms could suggest Bell's palsy. Otalgia or pain around the ear might indicate Ramsay Hunt syndrome. Travel history and Exposure to ticks are Relevant for Lyme disease. Systemic symptoms Such as fatigue, joint pains may suggest Lyme disease and sarcoidosis. Previous neurological symptoms or conditions may suggest multiple sclerosis or Guillain-Barré syndrome. I would also ask about Medical history, including Diabetes, hypertension, recent surgeries and trauma.",
    },
    {
      question: "What would you look for during your examination of this patient?",
      sample_answer: "I would assess the facial asymmetry and grade it with the house brackmann scale. I would also look for: Forehead movement, which is absent in peripheral causes, but present in central causes. Vesicles indicating Ramsay Hunt syndrome. Bell's phenomenon, which is an involuntary upward and outward movement of the eyeball that occurs when trying to close the eyes, to protect the cornea from damage. I would perfrom Ear examination To exclude otitis media or vesicles in the external auditory canal, which I will also look for on the palate. I would also perform Cranial nerve examination To identify other affected nerves. I would complete with Eye examination, assessing for dryness or abrasions due to incomplete closure.",
    },
    {
      question: "What investigations would you undertake for this patient?",
      sample_answer: "investigations would include: Blood tests: FBC, CRP, ESR for systemic inflammation, ACE/Ca levels for sarcoidosis, VDRL for syphilis, and specific IgG/M for Lyme disease. Audiometry: To assess any associated hearing loss, especially in temporal bone trauma. Imaging: High-resolution CT for bone trauma, MRI with gadolinium for neuromas/schwannomas, or to exclude cerebellopontine angle tumors. Electrophysiological studies: Nerve excitability test (NET), maximal stimulation test (MST), and electroneuronography (ENoG) for assessing nerve integrity and function.",
    },
    {
      question: "Describe the course of the facial nerve.",
      sample_answer: "The facial nerve's course is divided into intracranial, intra-temporal, and extra-temporal segments. It originates from the brainstem, entering the internal acoustic meatus, then traverses the temporal bone through the labyrinthine, tympanic, and mastoid segments, finally exiting the stylomastoid foramen to innervate the facial muscles. Notable branches include the greater petrosal nerve, chorda tympani, and branches to stapedius.",
    },
    {
      question: "If this were Bell's palsy, where along the course of the facial nerve would the problem reside?",
      sample_answer: "In Bell's palsy, the problem is believed to be at the geniculate ganglion or distal to it, where reactivation of HSV-1 leads to inflammation and swelling, causing compression and dysfunction of the nerve. In Ramsay Hunt syndrome, there is reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus in the geniculate ganglion.",
    },
    {
      question: "Tell me about the House Brackmann and Sunnybrook systems.",
      sample_answer: "The House Brackmann (HB) scale is a widely accepted system for grading facial nerve function, particularly in facial palsy. It categorizes facial nerve function into six grades, from I (normal function) to VI (no movement), based on the degree of facial movement and symmetry. It is simple and widely used but can be somewhat subjective and may not adequately quantify synkinesis or finer aspects of facial movement. The Sunnybrook system, on the other hand, offers a more comprehensive evaluation by quantifying facial symmetry at rest, voluntary movement, and synkinesis. It provides scores in these categories, leading to a more detailed assessment of facial function. This system allows for a nuanced understanding of the patient's condition, which is particularly useful in managing and tracking recovery and the effectiveness of treatments over time.",

    {
      question: "Tell me about the Sunderland classification.",
      sample_answer: "The Sunderland classification outlines five degrees of nerve injury: Class I: Neuropraxia with a temporary block of nerve conduction without axonal damage. Recovery is usually complete. Class II: Axonotmesis, where the axon is damaged but the surrounding connective tissue, i.e. myelin sheath, is intact. Wallerian degeneration occurs, but complete recovery is expected due to the intact endoneurial tubes which guide axonal regrowth. Class III: Neurotmesis, where the Damage extends to the axon and endoneurium but the nerve is not completely transected. Recovery may be partial and may involve synkinesis. Class IV: Involves disruption of all layers except the outermost epineurium. Surgical intervention is often required, and recovery may be incomplete. Class V: Complete transection of the nerve, requiring surgical repair for any hope of recovery.",
    },
    {
      question: "How would you treat this patient if they had Bell's palsy?",
      sample_answer: "For a patient diagnosed with Bell's palsy, treatment would focus on: Corticosteroids: Starting oral prednisolone within 72 hours of symptom onset to reduce inflammation and improve outcomes. Eye care: Protecting the eye from corneal damage due to incomplete closure, using lubricating drops during the day and ointment at night. Eye patching or taping might be necessary for nighttime protection. Physical therapy: Facial exercises to maintain muscle tone and prevent or reduce synkinesis as recovery progresses. Where the patient has a House Brackmann 5 or 6 palsy, I would add oral acyclovir.",
    },
    {
      question: "What would be the role of electrophysiology testing in this patient?",
      sample_answer: "Electroneuronography is most useful within the first 3 weeks post-onset for evaluating the degree of nerve degeneration, which helps in prognostication. Electromyography is valuable later in the course of the disease to assess for evidence of reinnervation or denervation, indicating whether the nerve is beginning to recover or if muscle atrophy is setting in. These tests are crucial for guiding treatment decisions, especially the consideration of surgical intervention in cases of severe degeneration.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is the prognosis of Bell's Palsy?",
      sample_answer: "The prognosis for Bell's palsy is generally good, with: 85% of patients showing significant improvement within three weeks. Most patients (85%) returning to normal or near-normal function within 9 months.",
    },
    {
      question: "What are the prognostic factors in Bell's palsy?",
      sample_answer: "Prognostic factors in Bell's palsy include: Severity of initial paralysis: More severe paralysis has a worse prognosis. Age: Younger patients tend to have a better prognosis. Rapid onset of symptoms: Faster onset is associated with a better outcome. Response to steroids: Early treatment with corticosteroids is associated with improved outcomes. Electrophysiological test results: Severe degeneration indicated by ENoG suggests a worse prognosis.",
    },
    {
      question: "What are the indications for an MRI IAM in Bell's palsy?",
      sample_answer: "Atypical presentation: Symptoms not characteristic of Bell's palsy, such as vestibular symptoms or hearing loss. Lack of improvement or worsening of symptoms: Especially if there's no improvement within 3-6 months, suggesting an alternate diagnosis might be present. Recurrent or bilateral facial palsy: Suggesting a systemic condition or tumor. Additional neurological symptoms: Indicating a possible central lesion.",
