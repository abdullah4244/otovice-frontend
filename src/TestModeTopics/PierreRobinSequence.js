      question: "You are called to the special care baby unit to review a newborn having difficulty breathing. What is your differential diagnosis for neonatal airway obstruction?",
      sample_answer: "The differential diagnosis for neonatal airway obstruction includes anatomical abnormalities (such as Pierre Robin sequence, choanal atresia, laryngomalacia, tracheomalacia, and subglottic stenosis) and neurologic conditions that lead to hypotonia and poor airway control.",
    },
    {
      question: "Please describe this image and give your diagnosis.",
      sample_answer: "This is a clinical photograph of an infant showing marked retrognathia and lowset ears. I suspect a diagnosis of pierre robin sequence, potentially in the context of a syndrome such as Treacher Collins syndrome.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is Pierre Robin Sequence?",
      sample_answer: "Pierre Robin Sequence (PRS) is a condition characterized by a sequence of developmental anomalies starting with micrognathia, leading to glossoptosis, that is downward displacement or retraction of the tongue, and resulting in airway obstruction. A U-shaped cleft palate is often a collateral feature, stemming from the glossoptosis which prevents the lateral palatal processes from descending and fusing. PRS can occur due to autosomal recessive inheritance or sporadically, and may be nonsyndromic or part of a syndrome.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is the difference between a sequence, an association and a syndrome?",
      sample_answer: "A sequence is a chain of anomalies triggered by a single known cause or event, like Pierre Robin sequence where micrognathia leads to glossoptosis and potentially a cleft palate. An association refers to the nonrandom occurrence of anomalies together more frequently than by chance alone, without a known causal link, such as VACTERL association. A syndrome is a recognized pattern of malformations with a single specific underlying cause, such as Down syndrome, caused by trisomy 21.",
    },
    {
      question: "What are the important aspects of your history when you encounter a neonate with Pierre Robin sequence in respiratory distress?",
      sample_answer: "Key historical aspects include Prenatal history, enquiring about oligohydramnios, twin pregnancy, maternal illness, and exposure to teratogens birth history, enquiring about Apgar scores, gestational age, initial feeding and breathing difficulties, Postnatal history, enquiring about episodes of cyanosis, especially when supine, feeding difficulties, and failure to thrive. I would also like to know about any family history of genetic syndromes or similar anomalies.",
    },
    {
      question: "During your clinical examination, what key features would you assess for in a newborn with suspected Pierre Robin sequence in respiratory distress?",
      sample_answer: "Clinical examination should assess for features of PRS including micrognathia, glossoptosis, and cleft palate. Additionally, I would look for signs of respiratory distress such as stertor, stridor, retractions & cyanosis, along with feeding difficulties, failure to thrive, and any ear anomalies or signs of syndromic associations such as ocular abnormalities as may occur with Stickler syndrome or characteristic facial features as occurs in velocardiofacial syndrome, where the patient has a long narrow face, tubular nose with a bulbous tip, narrow palpebral fissures, small mouth, and ears.",
    },
    {
      question: "What features might be present on antenatal imaging to alert you to the possibility of Pierre Robin Sequence?",
      sample_answer: "Antenatal imaging may show micrognathia, polyhydramnios (which might suggest a swallowing problem secondary to a cleft palate or glossoptosis), or oligohydramnios which has been theorised to limit chin growth. It may also be possible to see a cleft palate, but this is difficult.",
    },
    {
      question: "What investigations would you order for a neonate presenting with features of Pierre Robin sequence and respiratory distress?",
      sample_answer: "Investigations depend on the presentation and stability. I may perform flexible airway assessment to evaluate the airway, along with sleep studies. Genetic testing and consultations may also be appropriate.",
    },
    {
      question: "What syndromes are associated with Pierre Robin sequence?",
      sample_answer: "Syndromes associated with PRS include Stickler syndrome (18%), 22q11 deletion syndrome (VCFS, 7%), Treacher Collins syndrome (5%), Goldenhar syndrome (3%), and Nager syndrome. These syndromes present with additional anomalies beyond the triad seen in PRS.",

    {
      question: "What are the key considerations in managing the airway in a neonate with Pierre Robin sequence?",
      sample_answer: "Managing the airway in a neonate with Pierre Robin sequence (PRS) involves a comprehensive assessment to determine the severity of airway obstruction and the most appropriate intervention strategy. Key considerations include: Severity of Airway Obstruction: Assessing whether the airway obstruction is mild, moderate, or severe, based on clinical signs such as stertor, retractions, and cyanosis, especially in supine position. Feeding Difficulties: Evaluating for feeding difficulties due to glossoptosis and cleft palate, which may compound respiratory distress. Positioning: Initial non-invasive management often includes prone or side-lying positioning to facilitate easier breathing. Respiratory Support: The use of non-invasive respiratory support techniques such as continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or even a nasopharyngeal airway to maintain airway patency. Surgical Considerations: In cases where conservative measures are insufficient, surgical interventions such as mandibular distraction osteogenesis or glossopexy may be considered. Tracheostomy may be considered in severe cases where other interventions fail to adequately secure the airway. Monitoring and Follow-Up: Continuous monitoring for signs of respiratory distress, failure to thrive, or other complications. Regular follow-up is essential to reassess airway status, feeding, and growth, adjusting the management plan as the child grows. Associated Anomalies: Evaluation for syndromic associations that may influence management choices and long-term outcomes.",

      question: "How would you manage this neonate's airway?",
      sample_answer: "The management plan for a neonate with Pierre Robin sequence presenting with airway obstruction is tailored to the individual's needs and severity of symptoms: Initial Management: Optimize positioning by placing the neonate in prone or side-lying positions to improve airway patency. Non-Surgical Interventions: For mild to moderate airway obstruction, non-invasive measures such as the insertion of a nasopharyngeal airway or the application of CPAP may be sufficient to alleviate obstruction. Nutritional Support: Addressing feeding difficulties with specialized bottles or feeding techniques, and considering nasogastric or orogastric tube feeding for those unable to feed orally. Surgical Options: In cases of severe obstruction or failure of conservative management, surgical interventions such as mandibular distraction osteogenesis can be considered to physically enlarge the airway space. Glossopexy may be performed to stabilize the tongue position. Tracheostomy is considered when other measures are insufficient, providing a secure airway but also bearing long-term care considerations. Monitoring and Follow-Up: Continuous monitoring in a neonatal intensive care setting is crucial initially. Regular outpatient follow-up is necessary to adjust the management plan based on the child's growth, development, and resolution of airway and feeding issues. Interdisciplinary Approach: Collaborative care involving a multidisciplinary team including neonatologists, otolaryngologists, geneticists, speech therapists, and nutritionists is essential for addressing the complex needs of neonates with PRS.",

      question: "Are there any special considerations or precautions when placing BAHA implants in children with microtia?",
      sample_answer: "Yes, special considerations for patients with microtia include: Coordinating with a multidisciplinary team for optimal implant placement without interfering with future reconstructive surgery options. Preserving the integrity and vascular supply of post-auricular skin and tissue that might be used in reconstruction. and Adjusting the placement of the implant to accommodate for anatomical variances and future cosmetic procedures.",

    {
      question: "What is the role of middle ear implants in the treatment of hearing loss and how do they differ from BAHAs?",
      sample_answer: "Middle Ear Implants directly stimulate the ossicular chain or cochlear fluids, making them suitable for a wider range of hearing losses including mild to severe sensorineural, conductive, and mixed hearing loss. MEIs are fully or partially implantable devices that do not require an external component like hearing aids. In contrast, BAHAs bypass the middle ear entirely, transmitting sound vibrations through the skull bone to stimulate the cochlea but are limited to hearing loss up to 65 DBHL. MEIs are more discreet and avoid the occlusion effect, but they require intact middle ear structures for optimal function, unlike BAHAs.",
    },
    {
      question: "What are the components of a middle ear implant?",
      sample_answer: "A Middle Ear Implant (MEI) consists of the following components: Internal Receiver/Stimulator: This surgically implanted component receives the signal from the external sound processor. It converts the signal into mechanical vibrations. The receiver is often positioned under the skin behind the ear. Vibrating Ossicular Prosthesis or Actuator: Connected to the internal receiver/stimulator, this component directly drives one of the ossicles (e.g., the incus or stapes) or the round window membrane of the cochlea, depending on the design of the implant. External Sound Processor: Worn behind the ear, this device captures sound and converts it into electrical signals that are transmitted to the internal receiver. It functions similarly to a hearing aid but leverages the implanted components to stimulate the auditory system. Transmitting Coil: This external component, which may be integrated into the sound processor or be a separate piece, uses a magnetic field to wirelessly transmit the processed sound signals to the internal receiver/stimulator. Power Source: Both the external sound processor and the internal receiver/stimulator require power. The external processor is typically powered by batteries, while the internal component may be powered through inductive charging from the external processor.",

    {
      question: "How is the surgical placement of a BAHA performed, and what are the key considerations in selecting the implant site?",
      sample_answer: "Surgical placement of a BAHA involves: Choosing an optimal site, typically 5-6 cm posterior to the ear canal, in an area with adequate bone thickness and avoiding critical anatomical structures. Performing a small incision or using a punch technique to access the bone, followed by drilling and insertion of the titanium implant. Ensuring minimal tissue disruption and preserving vascular supply for better healing and reduced infection risk. Consideration of patient-specific factors, such as skull thickness, skin health, and potential for future procedures.",

    {
      question: "A patient comes to you with erythema around their implant site. How would you manage this?",
      sample_answer: "Management of erythema around the implant site follows the Holger classification: Grade I (Erythema without other symptoms): Initiate meticulous cleaning with mild antiseptic solutions and observe for improvement. Grade II (Erythema and moistness): Consider adding topical antibiotics and ensure the patient is correctly cleaning the area. Grade III (Granulation tissue): Treatment may include removal of granulation tissue, application of silver nitrate sticks, and possibly oral antibiotics if infection is suspected. Grade IV (Skin complications requiring implant removal): Rarely, if conservative management fails and infection is severe, implant removal may be necessary.",
