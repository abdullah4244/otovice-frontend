    {
      question: "What is your differential diagnosis for this picture?",
      sample_answer: "I would consider several categories when formulating a differential diagnosis for forehead swelling: Infectious causes: Foremost would be Pott's puffy tumour and frontal osteomyelitis, typically stemming from sinusitis. Other infectious possibilities include cellulitis or specific skin infections. Traumatic causes: Any recent trauma could lead to hematoma, or potentially a fracture of the frontal bone. Neoplastic causes: While less common, it's crucial to consider both benign and malignant tumors of the skin or underlying bone. Vascular causes: These could involve aneurysmal bone cysts or other vascular malformations. Inflammatory causes: Conditions like sarcoidosis or other systemic inflammatory diseases can manifest with forehead swelling.",
    },
    {
      question: "What would you ask during your history for this patient?",
      sample_answer: "In taking a history, I would focus on the following areas: Duration and evolution of symptoms: Determining how long the swelling has been present and any changes over time helps in understanding the acuteness or chronicity of the condition. Recent infections: Particularly, a history of sinusitis or upper respiratory tract infections that might predispose to sinus complications. Pain characteristics: Evaluating the presence and nature of pain can distinguish between infectious, traumatic, or neoplastic causes. Previous sinus or surgical history: Prior history of acute or chronic sinusitis or any nasal surgeries could suggest predisposition to sinus-related complications. Systemic symptoms: Fever, weight loss, night sweats, or other systemic signs could point to infectious or malignant causes. Neurological symptoms: Any changes in vision, headaches, or altered mental status could indicate possible intracranial extension of an infection.",

    {
      question: "What would you look for during your examination of this patient?",
      sample_answer: "During the physical examination, I would categorize my findings into: Inspection and palpation of the swelling: Noting characteristics like size, consistency, warmth, and pulsatility. A 'doughy' swelling could suggest a subperiosteal abscess. Neurological examination: Assessing for signs of meningismus (neck stiffness, photophobia, headache), focal neurological deficits, or any alteration in consciousness which might indicate intracranial involvement. Nasal examination: Using tools like anterior rhinoscopy or flexible nasendoscopy to assess for nasal discharge, polyps, or structural abnormalities which could suggest a source of ongoing sinus infection. Ophthalmic examination: Checking for proptosis, impaired eye movements, or visual disturbances that could indicate orbital or cavernous sinus involvement.",
    },
    {
      question: "What investigations would you undertake for this patient?",
      sample_answer: "I would plan a structured investigation approach: Radiological Imaging: CT Scan: Essential for assessing the bony architecture of the frontal sinuses and detecting any erosion or abscess formation. It helps in evaluating both the anterior and posterior tables of the frontal bone. MRI: Useful for detecting subtle brain involvement like cerebritis, dural enhancement, or small abscesses, especially in the context of intracranial extension. Microbiological Tests: Blood cultures or cultures from sinus drainage (if accessible) to identify causative organisms, which can guide antibiotic therapy. Blood Tests: Complete blood count to check for signs of infection or inflammation, and other relevant tests based on the clinical suspicion (e.g., inflammatory markers).",

      question: "What is a Pott's puffy tumour?",
      sample_answer: "Pott's puffy tumour is a clinical entity characterized by osteomyelitis of the frontal bone with an associated subperiosteal abscess, typically secondary to frontal sinusitis. The pathophysiology involves the spread of infection from the frontal sinus through the diploic veins, leading to thrombophlebitis and subsequent abscess formation. The common pathogens involved include Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus viridans. Clinically, it presents as a swollen, tender, and sometimes fluctuant mass on the forehead. This condition is potentially serious due to the risk of intracranial complications, including abscesses and meningitis.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do you manage a patient with Pott's puffy tumour?",
      sample_answer: "Management is via a Multidisciplinary Approach with Regular collaboration with neurosurgery and infectious disease specialists. It includes: Antibiotics: Broad-spectrum IV antibiotics, such as ceftriaxone, which crosses the blood-brain barrier, are used for a prolonged period (usually 6 weeks). Intranasal treatments include nasal saline rinsing, nasal decongestants and intranasal steroid drops. Surgical Intervention: Depending on the extent, Surgical intervention might include needle aspiration of the abscess, endoscopic sinus surgery to address the sinus disease, and, in severe cases, more extensive surgical procedures like frontal sinus trephine, open abscess drainage, or even cranialization of the frontal sinus in collaboration with neurosurgery if there is intracranial involvement. Supportive Care: Regular neurological assessments and supportive measures such as pain management and inflammation control.",
    },
    {
      question: "Describe how you do a frontal sinus trephine.",
      sample_answer: "A frontal sinus trephine is performed as follows: Incision: A small stab incision is made about 1 cm from the midline at the level of the medial eyebrow. Sinusotomy: Using a guide wire followed by a small drill with a 2 mm cutting burr to create an opening into the sinus. Trephination: A mini trephine tool is then introduced over the guide wire to access the sinus cavity directly. Verification: The patency of the sinusotomy and the effectiveness of the drainage can be confirmed endoscopically, sometimes using fluorescein dye to ensure the correct sinus is opened.",
    },
    {
      question: "What are your surgical approaches for managing the acute disease?",
      sample_answer: "In managing acute complications from sinusitis, such as Pott's puffy tumour, surgical options include: Endoscopic Approaches: These may involve limited endoscopic sinus drainage procedures like a Draf 1 procedure or balloon sinuplasty, or more advanced Draf procedures more aim to restore sinus ventilation and drainage. Open Surgical Approaches: In cases of extensive disease or failure of endoscopic techniques, procedures such as a frown-line incision for abscess drainage, frontal sinus trephine, or even a bi-coronal approach with osteoplastic flap for extensive reconstruction might be necessary.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do you manage this if there is intracranial extension?",
      sample_answer: "In these cases it is crucial to manage the patient with the neurosurgeons, as patient will need open drainage along with the endoscopic drainage. This is most likely going to be in the form of a bicoronal approach with Osteoplastic Flap and cranialisiation. This technique involves lifting a section of the frontal bone while preserving its blood supply, allowing for access to the underlying sinus and intracranial space. After abscess drainage and necessary debridement, the bone flap is replaced and secured. If the posterior table of the frontal sinus is involved or breached, cranialization might be necessary. This procedure involves removing the posterior table and potentially part of the frontal sinus floor to make the sinus part of the intracranial cavity, thereby eliminating any sinus cavity where infection could recur. After adequate drainage and clearance of infection, reconstruction of the affected areas might involve the use of autologous materials such as pericranial or fascia lata grafts to seal off the sinus and cranial cavities, particularly in cases where significant debridement or bone removal was necessary. Management is completed with prolonged antibiotic therapy, which is guided by microbiological culture results or empirical best guesses initially, to ensure eradication of the infection. Intensive Monitoring and Support: Postoperative care includes close monitoring for signs of infection resolution, neurological function, and prevention of secondary complications in an intensive care setting.",

    {
      question: "Tell me about the Draf Procedures",
      sample_answer: "The Draf procedures are a series of graded endoscopic techniques aimed at improving frontal sinus drainage: Draf I: Involves an uncinectomy and removal of agger nasi cells, sparing the frontal recess. Draf IIa: Extends the opening of the frontal sinus from the lamina papyracea to the middle turbinate. Draf IIb: Further extends to opening the frontal sinus from the lamina papyracea to the nasal septum, including the removal of the head of the middle turbinate. Draf III (Modified Lothrop): This is the most extensive, creating a direct path from one side of the sinus to the other by removing the central bony septum and parts of the sinus floor, enhancing the overall sinus ventilation and drainage.",
