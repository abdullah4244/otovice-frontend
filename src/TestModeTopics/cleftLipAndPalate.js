      question: "What is cleft lip and palate?",
      sample_answer: "Cleft lip and palate is a congenital malformation where there is a failure of the normal fusion of structures of the lip and/or palate. It can involve the lip, the anterior part of the palate (primary palate), or the posterior part (secondary palate). The condition can range from a small notch in the lip to a complete separation extending into the nose and down through the palate into the throat. It is the most common congenital malformation, with cleft lip (with or without palate) occurring in about 1 in 900 births and cleft palate alone in 1 in 1,500 births",

    {
      question: "What are the key components of history and examination in a neonate with cleft lip and palate?",
      sample_answer: "History should include: Feeding history: Enquiring about issues such as feeding difficulties, choking episodes, Details on the infant's ability to latch, presence of nasal regurgitation and the length of feeds Prenatal history: Enquiring about Exposure to risk factors such as maternal smoking, alcohol consumption, use of medications such as retinoids, valproate, carbamazepine, folate deficiency, and maternal diabetes. Family history of cleft lip and palate or other syndromes. Examination should encompass assessment of: The oral cavity, to ascertain The type and extent of the cleft, that is lip and/or palate, unilateral or bilateral, complete or incomplete. Craniofacial examination looking for craniofacial abnormalities e.g., microtia, ear pits/tags, mandibular hypoplasia, retrognatia and abnormalities of the eyes. Nasal examination, assessing the nasal ala, columella and nasal septum for deformity and displacement. Systemic examination, assessing for Cardiac, genitourinary, and limb anomalies. Feeding effectiveness, noting any regurgitation or difficulty sucking. And Airway adequacy and any signs of respiratory distress.",
    },
    {
      question: "What investigations should you carry out for this infant?",
      sample_answer: "Investigations would be guided by clinical presentation, but I would consider: Genetic Testing and Consultation: To identify any underlying genetic syndromes associated with cleft lip and palate such as 22q11, treacher collins or goldenhar syndromes. Audiological Assessment with OAEs, ABR & tympanometry assess for any hearing impairment due to middle ear effusion common in children with cleft palate. Sleep Study may be useful if there are indications of airway obstruction or sleep apnea.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is the embryologic origin of cleft lip and palate?",
      sample_answer: "Cleft lip and palate result from incomplete fusion of the facial structures during embryonic development. The face forms from the frontonasal prominence, maxillary prominences, and mandibular prominences. The primary palate forms from the fusion of the frontonasal and maxillary prominences around the 6th week, and the secondary palate forms from the fusion of palatal shelves from the 9th week, completing by the 12th week. Disruption in these processes leads to cleft formation.",
    },
    {
      question: "How is cleft lip and palate classified?",
      sample_answer: "The Veau classification system is used for cleft palate and categorizes the defects based on their anatomical location: Group I: Isolated cleft of the soft palate. Group II: Cleft of the soft and hard palates extending to the incisive foramen. Group III: Complete unilateral cleft of the lip, alveolus, and palate. Group IV: Complete bilateral clefts of the lip, alveolus, and palate.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is the LAHSHAL notation system for cleft lip and palate?",
      sample_answer: "The LAHSHAL notation system is a comprehensive and detailed method used to describe the anatomical location and severity of cleft lip and palate anomalies. This system uses a combination of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, asterisks, and dots to represent the specific aspects and severity of the cleft condition across various structures from right to left: L (Right Lip), A (Right Alveolus), H (Right Hard Palate), S (Soft Palate), H (Left Hard Palate), A (Left Alveolus), L (Left Lip). The use of uppercase or lowercase letters indicates whether the cleft is complete (uppercase) or incomplete (lowercase), with an asterisk (*) denoting a minimal cleft. A dot (â€¢) signifies that the anatomical part is normally developed. This system can describe over 12,000 combinations of anatomy and severity for cleft lip and/or palate (CL/P).",
    },
    {
      question: "What are the risk factors for the development of cleft lip and palate?",
      sample_answer: "Risk factors include genetic predisposition, environmental influences (such as maternal smoking, alcohol consumption, and certain medications), folate deficiency, and maternal diabetes. There's a higher prevalence in certain ethnicities such as caucasians and a noted difference in gender distribution, with males more frequently having cleft lip and females more isolated cleft palates.",
    },
    {
      question: "Who are the members of the Cleft MDT?",
      sample_answer: "The multidisciplinary team (MDT) includes cleft surgeons, ENT surgeons, geneticists, cleft specialist nurses, craniofacial consultants, audiologists, orthodontists, dentists, psychologists, and speech and language therapists.",
    },
    {
      question: "What ENT problems would you have to treat as part of your role in the Cleft MDT?",
      sample_answer: "ENT issues include treating airway obstructions, speech difficulties through interventions like speech therapy and pharyngoplasty, managing feeding difficulties with specialized equipment, addressing otological problems such as chronic otitis media with effusion by potentially placing grommets, and monitoring hearing.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do you treat feeding difficulties in a neonate with cleft lip and palate?",
      sample_answer: "Feeding difficulties are addressed by using special nipples such as the Haberman or Mead Johnson nipples, along with bottles designed for cleft patients to facilitate effective feeding. I also promote upright feeding positions to minimize regurgitation, and may using palatal obturators or preoperative nasoalveolar molding to assist with feeding.",
    },
    {
      question: "Discuss the role of nasoalveolar molding (NAM) in the management of infants with cleft lip and palate.",
      sample_answer: "NAM is used pre-surgically to reduce the severity of the cleft and improve nasal shape, thereby decreasing the complexity of the cleft repair surgery. It involves molding the alveolus and nasal cartilages with a custom appliance, facilitating a more effective and aesthetic repair.",
    },
    {
      question: "What syndromes are associated with cleft lip and palate?",
      sample_answer: "Syndromes associated with cleft lip and palate include Treacher Collins syndrome, Velocardiofacial syndrome, Goldenhar syndrome, Di George syndrome, Down Syndrome, Stickler Syndrome, and Van der Woude syndrome.",
    },
    {
      question: "How would you manage this patient as they grow up?",
      sample_answer: "Management of a patient with cleft lip and palate involves a series of interventions planned according to the child's age and developmental milestones: Birth: Evaluation by the Cleft MDT, initiation of nasoalveolar molding if appropriate, and specialized feeding techniques. 3-4 Months: Surgical repair of the cleft lip, often following the 'rule of tens' (at least 10 weeks old, 10 pounds weight, and hemoglobin of 10 g/dL). Placement of grommets might be considered if there is evidence of middle ear effusion impacting hearing. 10-12 Months: Cleft palate repair, aiming to restore the division between the oral and nasal cavities and to reconstruct the muscle function of the soft palate. This timing also takes into consideration the impact on speech development and the reduced risk of otitis media. 3-5 Years: Ongoing speech therapy and consideration of secondary surgical interventions such as columellar lengthening in patients with bilateral clefts and nasal tip revision. Evaluation for early orthodontic intervention may also occur around this time. 6-8 Years: Alveolar bone grafting before the eruption of the permanent canine teeth to support the alveolar ridge and facilitate dental development. 8 - 16 years: Orthodontic procedures. Adolescence: Comprehensive orthodontic treatment to address bite and alignment issues. Further cosmetic or functional surgical interventions might be planned, such as rhinoplasty or jaw surgery, based on individual needs.",

    {
      question: "What technique would you use to repair the cleft lip?",
      sample_answer: "At 10 weeks, the Millard rotation-advancement technique is commonly used for unilateral cleft lip repair to reconstruct the lip anatomy, including the orbicularis oris muscle, and to achieve a balanced appearance of the cupid's bow and nasal symmetry. For bilateral clefts, a similar approach may be employed, often in conjunction with nasal cartilage reshaping and prolabium repair to address the broader anatomical challenges.",
    },
    {
      question: "What technique would you use to repair the palate at 10 months?",
      sample_answer: "At 10 months, a common technique for palate repair is the Bardach Two-Flap Palatoplasty. This method involves creating two bipedicle flaps from the palatal tissue that are then rotated and sutured together to close the cleft in the hard and soft palate. This technique allows for muscular reconstruction and aims to restore the normal function of the palate, particularly important for speech development and reducing the risk of fluid entering the nasal passages from the oral cavity.",
