      question: "Please describe this image",
      sample_answer: "This is an otoendoscopic image of an ear showing a granulation in the external auditory canal, with associated erythema, crusting and mucopurulent discharge behind it.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is your differential diagnosis for this picture?",
      sample_answer: "It includes: Infectious Causes such as Necrotizing otitis externa, acute otitis externa, chronic suppurative otitis media. Neoplastic Causes such as squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma. Inflammatory Causes such as Granulomatosis with polyangiitis and external auditory canal cholesteatoma. and miscelaneous causes such as Osteoradionecrosis in patients with a history of radiation therapy.",
    },
    {
      question: "What would you ask during your history for this patient?",
      sample_answer: "I would ask about symptom History, particularly Duration and character of otalgia, which I expect to be progressive, severe & persistent, including at night. I would ask about Associated symptoms such as otorrhoea, hearing loss, changes in taste, and the presence of facial weakness. I would enquire about Risk Factors such as Diabetes mellitus, immunocompromised states such as HIV, chemotherapy, steroid and DMARDs use, as well as previous radiation therapy. I would also ask about Previous Infections, treatments, and response to treatments. Finally, I would assess Functional Impact on daily activities, such as sleep disturbance due to pain, difficulty in chewing or trismus, and any changes in facial sensation or movement.",
    },
    {
      question: "What would you look for during your examination of this patient?",
      sample_answer: "I would begin with General Examination, looking for Signs of systemic infection such as fever or malaise, palpation of the mastoid area for tenderness, and assessment of the temporomandibular joint for trismus. I would then perform Otoscopic Examination which may show Granulation tissue at the bony-cartilaginous junction of the EAC, exposed bone within the canal, discharge, and edema of the canal. A Cranial Nerve Assessment, looking for Palsies involving the facial nerve, hypoglossal, glossopharyngeal, and vagus nerves, which indicate spread to the skull base. I would also perform tuning fork tests to assess the character of any hearing loss.",
    },
    {
      question: "This patient has presented with severe, persistent otalgia not relieved by over-the-counter medications, otorrhea resistant to usual treatments, and hearing loss. They have a history of diabetes mellitus and previous episodes of otitis externa. He is well and there are no cranial nerve palsies. How will you proceed to investigate him?",
      sample_answer: "Given my suspicion of necrotizing otitis externa, I would undertake Laboratory Tests, including Complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate & C-reactive protein to assess for inflammation and infection, blood glucose, and HbA1c to monitor diabetes control. Microbiology wise, I would send an Ear discharge swab for culture and sensitivity, specifically looking for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but also other bacteria and fungi. Cross sectional Imaging would be in the form of a high resolution CT scan of the temporal bones for assessment of bone involvement, erosion, and extent of infection. Gadolinium enhanced MRI would assess for soft tissue changes, especially if cranial nerve involvement is suspected and for establishing the baseline. I would also Biopsy the granulation tissue in the EAC to rule out malignancy and confirm the presence of infection versus neoplastic processes.",
    },
    {
      question: "This is the patient's CT scan, please describe it.",
      sample_answer: "This is an axial CT scan showing erosion of the posterior wall of the right EAC along with opacification of the mastoid air cells. This would be highly suspicious of necrotising otitis externa.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is necrotizing otitis externa?",
      sample_answer: "Necrotizing otitis externa is a severe infection of the external auditory canal that extends to the bone and cartilage, often reaching the skull base. Primarily affecting immunocompromised patients, especially those with diabetes mellitus. It is characterized by severe, persistent otalgia, otorrhea, and, potentially, cranial nerve involvement. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the most common pathogen. The condition represents a progression from untreated or refractory otitis externa and can lead to osteomyelitis of the skull base.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do you classify necrotising otitis externa?",
      sample_answer: "N O E can be classified by it's direction of spread; Anteriorly towards the TMJ Medially towards the petrous apex Posteriorly towards the mastoid process And intracranially, with dural or venous sinus involvement.",
    },
    {
      question: "How would you treat this patient?",
      sample_answer: "Treatment involves a multidisciplinary approach including ENT, infectious diseases, and endocrinology for diabetes management. Initial management involves Intravenous antibiotics based on culture and sensitivity, commonly starting with broad-spectrum antibiotics targeting Pseudomonas aeruginosa, such as intravenous ceftazidime 2 grams TDS and PO ciprofloxacine at 750miligrams BD, for at least 6 weeks followed by oral antibiotics. Other important aspects are Pain management with analgesics, regular Aural toilet for the removal of debris and discharge and Tight glycemic control in diabetic patients. Regular monitoring of inflammatory markers and repeat imaging in the form of MRI is crucial to assess response to treatment, including at 6 weeks post cessation of antibiotics, with 6 months of follow up.",
    },
    {
      question: "Discuss the surgical interventions for managing necrotizing otitis externa",
      sample_answer: "Surgical intervention may be considered for debridement of necrotic tissue, biopsy to rule out malignancy, and drainage of any abscesses. Surgical interventions are generally reserved for cases that do not respond to medical treatment or when there is a suspicion of malignancy. Risks include damage to surrounding structures, including cranial nerves, and potential for spreading the infection.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is the prognosis of this condition? What are the important prognostic factors?",
      sample_answer: "The prognosis for necrotizing otitis externa has improved with aggressive medical and sometimes surgical treatment but remains serious, especially in patients with poor glycemic control, advanced age, and significant cranial nerve involvement. Key prognostic factors include the patientÂ’s overall health and immune status, promptness of diagnosis and treatment initiation, and the extent of infection and cranial nerve involvement at the time of diagnosis.",
    },
    {
      question: "You mentioned CT and MRI, are there any other imaging options?",
      sample_answer: "Yes, there are nuclear medicine scans such as Gallium-67 Citrate Scans which have a role in patients with equivocal MRI or CT findings or in monitoring response to therapy. Technetium-99m Bone Scans have low specificity but Can show increased osteoblastic activity, indicating bone infection. Indium-111 White Blood Cell Scans can help identify areas of active infection, especially in complex cases or when other imaging is inconclusive.",
