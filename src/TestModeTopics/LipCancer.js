      question: "Please describe this image",
      sample_answer: "This is a clinical photograph of a female patient with a lesion on the left lower lip. The lesion is raised and irregular with some crusting.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is your differential diagnosis for this patient?",
      sample_answer: "When examining a lesion on the lower lip, my differential diagnosis would broadly categorize into benign and malignant entities. For benign lesions, I would consider actinic cheilitis, particularly given its prevalence in areas exposed to the sun; infectious causes like herpes simplex virus leading to cold sores; and traumatic ulcers, which might result from biting or abrasion against teeth. Benign neoplasms such as fibromas due to irritation could also present similarly. In the spectrum of malignant possibilities, squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) stands out as the predominant type, given its strong association with chronic sun exposure and tobacco use. Basal cell carcinoma could also be considered, especially on the upper lip, given its relationship with UV light exposure. Less common malignancies might include melanoma or malignant salivary gland tumors. Each diagnosis requires careful consideration of the lesion’s characteristics, patient history, and risk factors.",
    },
    {
      question: "Would you ask during your history for this patient?",
      sample_answer: "I would focus on: Symptomatology: I'd inquire about the onset, duration, and progression of the lesion. Questions regarding changes in size, color, or symptomatology such as pain or bleeding are crucial. I would also ask about any recent trauma or injury to the lip area. Lifestyle and Risk Factors: Understanding the patient’s exposure to risk factors is vital. This includes tobacco use (smoking or chewing), alcohol consumption, and significant sun exposure without protection. Dietary habits and occupational hazards would also be relevant. Personal Medical History: Previous diagnoses of skin or lip lesions, including actinic cheilitis, leukoplakia, or erythroplakia, are pertinent. A history of head and neck cancers or precancerous lesions and any treatments undertaken would be relevant. Inquiry about general dental health and any recent dental procedures could uncover a source of chronic irritation. Family History: I would also assess for a family history of cancer, particularly skin or oral cancers, to evaluate genetic predisposition.",
    },
    {
      question: "What would you look for during your examination of this patient?",
      sample_answer: "My examination would be thorough, looking for: Lesion Characteristics: I would assess the size, shape, color, and surface characteristics of the lesion—whether it is ulcerated, crusted, or exhibits raised edges. Attention to asymmetry, irregular borders, and color variegation is key, especially for melanoma. Palpation: By palpating the lesion and surrounding tissue, I'd assess for firmness, induration, and fixation to deeper structures, which might indicate malignancy. Palpation of regional lymph nodes, particularly the submental and submandibular nodes, would help identify potential metastatic spread. Mucosal Involvement: Examination of the inner lip mucosa for any signs of extension or secondary lesions is crucial, as this might impact staging and treatment. Extraoral Examination: A thorough examination of the entire skin, especially sun-exposed areas, is important for signs of actinic damage, other suspicious lesions, or signs of systemic diseases that might present with oral manifestations.",
    },
    {
      question: "What investigations would you undertake for this patient?",
      sample_answer: "Investigations would be led by the clinical picture, but generally I would perform a punch biopsy to diagnose the lesion and give me sub-typing if it is an SCC or BCC. If there were any clinically suspicious nodes, I would perform an US Neck with FNA cytology.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is the distribution of cancers on the lip?",
      sample_answer: "The lower lip is overwhelmingly the most common site for lip cancers, accounting for approximately 90% of cases, due to its greater exposure to solar radiation. The upper lip and oral commissure are less commonly affected, with the upper lip accounting for about 7% of cases and the commissure for about 3%. Squamous cell carcinoma is the predominant histological type. Upper lip cancers tend to be BCCs.",
    },
    {
      question: "How would you manage squamous cell carcinoma of the lower lip?",
      sample_answer: "For early-stage SCC of the lower lip, surgical excision with clear margins is the preferred approach due to its high efficacy and low impact on lip function. Advanced stages might require more extensive surgical interventions with potential reconstruction. Elective neck dissection is considered based on tumor size, depth, and involvement. In cases where surgery is not feasible, radiotherapy may be an alternative. Adjuvant therapy, such as radiotherapy, is considered in cases with high-risk features including deep invasion, lymph node involvement, or positive margins after surgery.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do you manage the neck in the context of lip cancer?",
      sample_answer: "Management of the neck in lip cancer generally involves a conservative approach due to the relatively low risk of occult metastasis. However, for tumors with high-risk features, significant oral mucosa involvement, or clinically positive lymph nodes, approaches similar to oral cavity cancers, including elective or therapeutic neck dissection and possibly adjuvant radiotherapy, might be considered to ensure comprehensive management.",
    },
    {
      question: "Tell me about margins in lip cancer.",
      sample_answer: "In surgical resection of lip cancer, achieving clear margins is pivotal for minimizing recurrence risk. A margin of 3 mm is generally considered adequate for most lip SCCs, although larger margins (5 mm) might be sought in cases where the tumor approaches or involves the oral mucosa. Positive margins necessitate further intervention, which may include additional surgical resection or adjuvant radiotherapy.",

    {
      question: "What are the reconstructive options following surgery for lip cancer, and when would each be used?",
      sample_answer: "Following lip cancer surgery, reconstruction aims to restore both form and function, with options varying by the size and location of the defect: Primary Closure: Used for small defects where direct suturing can achieve a satisfactory outcome without significant functional impairment. Local Flaps: Employed for moderate defects, these involve tissue rearrangement from adjacent areas, preserving lip functionality and aesthetics. Techniques include the Karapandzic, Abbe-Estlander, and Gillies fan flaps, each chosen based on the specific needs and defect size. Regional or Free Flaps: Reserved for extensive defects where local tissue is insufficient. These methods provide larger amounts of tissue for reconstruction but may involve more complex surgeries. Free flap reconstruction might be considered for extensive defects affecting both lip and adjacent structures, aiming to achieve the best possible functional and aesthetic outcome while ensuring adequate oncologic control.",
    },
    {
      question: "Tell me about the local flaps and when they should be used",
      sample_answer: "Reconstruction depends on the size of the defect, location, and the specific goal of preserving lip function and aesthetics. For Small Defects (<1/2 of the lip width): Wedge Resection and Primary Closure: This approach is suitable for smaller defects, utilizing a simple excision followed by direct suturing. It's effective for maintaining the natural contour and function of the lip with minimal scarring. For Medium to Larger Defects (1/2 to 2/3 of the lip width): Peri-Alar Crescentic Flap (Advancement Flap): Utilized for both upper and lower lips, this technique involves creating a crescent-shaped flap near the nostril to close the defect. It's beneficial for its simplicity and the ability to advance adjacent tissue into the defect. Karapandzic Flap: Ideal for larger defects, especially when central lip preservation is paramount. It maintains oral competence, sensation, and muscular function but can lead to microstomia due to the circumferential movement of tissue towards the defect. Abbé (and Abbé-Estlander) Flap: A cross-lip flap that transfers tissue from the unaffected lip to the defect, preserving vascular supply. It’s used for defects between one-third and two-thirds of the lip width. The technique is advantageous for preserving the vermillion and achieving a good aesthetic result but requires a secondary procedure to divide the pedicle. Bilateral Gillies Fan Flap (Nasolabial Transposition Flap): This technique is used for upper lip reconstructions, leveraging the flexibility of nasolabial skin. It provides good aesthetic outcomes by matching skin color and texture. Bernard-Burrow Technique: This classical method for larger lower lip reconstructions involves creating flaps from the remaining lip and cheek tissue, then advancing them to cover the defect. It may result in some degree of microstomia but effectively restores lip function and appearance.",
