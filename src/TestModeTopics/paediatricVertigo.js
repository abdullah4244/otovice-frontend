      question: "What is your differential diagnosis for pediatric vertigo?",
      sample_answer: "Differential diagnosis for pediatric vertigo can be categorized as follows: Peripheral Vestibular Disorders: This includes conditions like otitis media-related imbalance, peripheral vestibular dysfunction associated with sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood, labyrinthine concussion, perilymph fistula, and vestibular neuritis. Central Causes: These are conditions like migraine-associated vertigo, temporal lobe seizures, posterior fossa and cerebellopontine angle tumors, Chiari malformation, and central nervous system infections or inflammations. Other Causes: Metabolic diseases, toxicity, conditions like Cogan syndrome, and other peripheral vestibular disorders not specified elsewhere.",
    },
    {
      question: "How does pediatric vertigo differ in presentation from that of adults?",
      sample_answer: "Pediatric vertigo often presents with symptoms such as clumsiness, difficulty articulating the experience of dizziness, episodic vertigo similar to adults but with gross motor delays from congenital or early acquired loss of vestibular organ function. Children may describe their symptoms in less specific terms, such as feeling 'clumsy' or 'unsteady', unlike adults who may clearly describe episodes of spinning or imbalance.",
    },
    {
      question: "What specific history would you obtain in a child presenting with vertigo?",
      sample_answer: "When evaluating a child with vertigo, the history should be categorized as follows: Episodic Symptoms: History of recurrent episodes suggests migraine headaches or its variants, seizures, or perilymphatic fistula. Nausea and Vomiting: Common in acute vertigo and may indicate vestibular migraine or peripheral causes. Precipitating Factors: Include head motion, position changes, preceding head or middle ear trauma, and changes in middle ear pressure. Also, inquire about recent travels which might suggest motion sickness. Associated Symptoms: Fever (indicating infection), altered mental status (suggesting CNS infection or mass), hearing loss (suggesting inner ear or nerve involvement), and symptoms of brainstem pathology.",
    },
    {
      question: "During the physical examination of a child with vertigo, what findings are you specifically looking for?",
      sample_answer: "Physical examination should focus on: Vital Signs: Fever suggesting infection, and orthostatic changes indicating presyncope. Ocular Nystagmus: Key feature indicating vestibular dysfunction, assessing its type and behavior. Ear Examination: Identifying conditions like otitis media, mastoiditis, tympanic membrane abnormalities, and hearing loss. Neurologic Examination: Assessing for altered mental status, cranial nerve abnormalities, motor or sensory changes, and signs of cerebellar dysfunction. Tests of Vestibular Function: Including the head impulse test and examination for ocular tilt reaction and head-shaking nystagmus.",
    },
    {
      question: "What, if any, investigations would you recommend for a pediatric patient with vertigo and why?",
      sample_answer: "Investigations for pediatric vertigo should be guided by clinical findings: Neuroimaging (MRI or CT): Indicated for suspected central causes, evidence of central vestibular abnormalities, or focal neurologic findings. Audiometry: For children with hearing loss or when a peripheral vestibular disorder is suspected. Specialized Vestibular Testing: Such as videonystagmography or posturography, recommended when vertigo is suspected but not confirmed by history and physical examination, or for differentiation between central versus peripheral causes.",

    {
      question: "What's pediatric vestibular migraine?",
      sample_answer: "Pediatric vestibular migraine presents with episodes of vertigo, dizziness, or balance disturbances, with or without accompanying migraine headache. It's characterized by symptoms that can last from minutes to hours, often associated with nausea, vomiting, or sensitivity to light or sound, and may have a significant impact on a child's daily activities.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood?",
      sample_answer: "Benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood is characterized by sudden, brief episodes of vertigo without hearing loss, typically affecting young children. These episodes are self-limiting, and children are normal between episodes. It's considered a migraine variant and may be a precursor to typical migraine headaches later in life.",
    },
    {
      question: "What treatment options are available for pediatric patients with vestibular migraine?",
      sample_answer: "Treatment options for pediatric vestibular migraine include: Acute Treatment: Use of NSAIDs or triptans for headache relief. Preventive Treatment: Consideration of migraine preventive medications in frequent cases. Lifestyle Modifications: Regular sleep patterns, hydration, and avoidance of known triggers. Vestibular Rehabilitation: For persistent balance disturbances.",
    },
    {
      question: "What treatment options are available for benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood?",
      sample_answer: "Treatment mainly focuses on managing symptoms and may include: Reassurance: Explaining the benign nature of the condition to parents. Symptomatic Treatment: Use of anti-nausea medication during episodes. Preventive Strategies: Identifying and avoiding triggers.",
    },
    {
      question: "What are the associations of pediatric vestibular migraine?",
      sample_answer: "Pediatric vestibular migraine may be associated with a family history of migraines, and children with this condition may have an increased risk of developing classic migraine headaches later in life. It's also associated with motion sickness and other episodic syndromes that may be associated with migraine.",
    },
    {
      question: "How does benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood typically resolve, and what long-term considerations should be taken into account?",
      sample_answer: "Benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood typically resolves spontaneously, often by the time children reach school age. Long-term considerations include monitoring for the development of migraine headaches, as many children with this condition may develop migraines later in life.",
