      question: "What is your differential diagnosis for this patient who is presenting with recurrent episodes of this right neck lump?",
      sample_answer: "For recurrent submandibular swelling, my differential diagnoses would include sialolithiasis as the most common cause, particularly due to its characteristic exacerbation post-meals indicating a blockage in salivary flow. Duct strictures and mucus plugs are also possibilities, potentially leading to similar episodic symptoms by obstructing salivary outflow. Neoplasms, both benign (like pleomorphic adenoma, Warthin’s tumor, oncocytoma) and malignant (such as mucoepidermoid carcinoma, adenoid cystic carcinoma), though usually presenting with a progressively enlarging mass, could cause intermittent swelling due to secondary obstruction or infection. Foreign bodies, although rare, could physically obstruct the duct leading to similar clinical presentations. Sjögren’s syndrome and IgG4-related disease, both causing chronic sialadenitis, could present with recurrent gland swelling but are typically associated with systemic features.",

    {
      question: "What would you inquire about during your history taking for this patient?",
      sample_answer: "During history taking, I would methodically cover several areas: Onset, duration, and progression of symptoms: To gauge the chronicity and identify any precipitating events. Sudden onset following a meal strongly suggests sialolithiasis, while a gradual onset might lean towards neoplastic causes. Relation to eating: Swelling or pain that worsens post-prandially points towards an obstructive process like sialolithiasis or duct stricture. History of infections and antibiotic treatment: Recurrent infections treated with antibiotics could indicate underlying sialadenitis or predispose to stone formation. Dental history: To check for recent dental procedures or chronic dental issues that could be the source of bacterial infection leading to sialadenitis. Red flag symptoms: Such as unexplained weight loss, persistent pain, or dysphagia, odynophagia or unilateral otalgia might suggest malignancy. Smoking and alcohol use: Both are risk factors for salivary gland tumors. Systemic diseases: Questions about diabetes, HIV, and autoimmune conditions like Sjögren’s syndrome, as these can affect salivary gland function and predispose to sialadenitis.",

    {
      question: "What would you look for during your examination of this patient?",
      sample_answer: "My examination would focus on: Inspection for swelling or asymmetry: Noting any visible enlargement of the submandibular area. Palpation: Bimanual palpation of the submandibular gland and floor of the mouth for stones or firmness, and the gland itself for any irregularity or tenderness suggesting sialolithiasis or neoplasm. Neck examination: For lymphadenopathy, which could accompany infection or malignancy. Dryness of mouth or eyes: Suggestive of systemic conditions like Sjögren’s syndrome. Oral cavity inspection: For poor dental hygiene or lesions that could be a source of infection. Purulence on gland massage: Indicative of acute sialadenitis. The patient may also present acutely unwell, so it is prudent to check for fever, tachycardia and tachypnoea.",
    },
    {
      question: "What investigations would you undertake for this patient?",
      sample_answer: "The investigations would include: Ultrasound (USS): To detect stones, evaluate for duct dilation, and identify any masses. It’s non-invasive and can guide further management. MRI/CT scans: For comprehensive evaluation of glandular and surrounding tissue pathology, especially for suspected neoplasms or to identify radiolucent stones. Fine Needle Aspiration Biopsy (FNA): Essential for characterizing the nature of a mass, differentiating between benign and malignant tumors. Sialography: Particularly useful for delineating the ductal anatomy, identifying strictures, or small stones not visible on USS, but there is a significant risk of causing sialedenitis and it is not commonly used anymore. Blood tests: Including FBC, U&E, CRP and ESR to assess for infection and inflammation, then serology for Sjögren’s syndrome (Anti-SSA/Ro and Anti-SSB/La antibodies) or other specific tests depending on history and examination.",

      question: "What are the options for treating submandibular gland stones?",
      sample_answer: "Treatment options range based on the size, location, and symptomatology of the stones: Conservative measures including hydration, sialogogues, and gland massage for smaller, non-obstructive stones. Sialendoscopy offers a minimally invasive approach for stone removal, particularly for stones up to 4 mm, and for exploring and dilating ductal strictures. Lithotripsy (extracorporeal or intraductal) for fragmenting larger stones into passable pieces. Surgical removal for stones not amenable to less invasive methods or for recurrent, symptomatic cases. This might involve a transoral approach or, in complex cases, submandibular gland excision.",
    },
    {
      question: "The patient is acutely unwell, with fever and swelling. They also have a palpable and visible stone in the floor of the mouth. How do you treat them?",
      sample_answer: "In this acute setting, the patient would require aggressive management including hydration and systemic antibiotics targeting common pathogens like Staphylococcus aureus to address the infection. Analgesics would be prescribed for pain relief. Sialogogues would be used to stimulate saliva flow, potentially aiding in the expulsion of the stone. Given the visible stone, an attempt at manual removal under local anesthesia with laying open of the duct might be warranted if the stone is accessible and the patient's condition allows. If not feasible, sialendoscopy for stone removal could be considered as an urgent intervention.",
    },
    {
      question: "Why is the submandibular gland more prone to stones than the parotid gland?",
      sample_answer: "The submandibular gland is more prone to stone formation due to the physicochemical composition of its saliva, which is higher in calcium and mucin, contributing to stone formation. Additionally, the anatomy of the submandibular duct, being longer and its saliva flowing against gravity, predisposes to saliva stasis and subsequent stone formation.",
    },
    {
      question: "What would be the indications for submandibular gland excision?",
      sample_answer: "Indications for submandibular gland excision include recurrent, chronic sialadenitis refractory to conservative treatment, large or multiple sialoliths not amenable to less invasive removal, and neoplasms (benign or malignant) necessitating complete gland removal for curative intent or symptom relief.",

      question: "What would you tell a patient undergoing submandibular gland excision during the consent process?",
      sample_answer: "I would discuss benefits, including, Resolution of Symptoms, Prevention of Future Episodes and Elimination of Infection Source. The Risks of the procedure include general and specific risks, with general risks encompassing bleeding, infection, pain and adverse GAP reaction, whilst specific risks include Nerve Damage, in particular: Marginal Mandibular Nerve Injury: which Could result in temporary or permanent weakness of the lower lip on the operated side, affecting facial symmetry and functions such as speaking and eating. Lingual Nerve Injury which May lead to temporary or permanent numbness, tingling, or loss of taste sensation in the tongue on the affected side. Hypoglossal Nerve Damage which Could cause weakness or paralysis of the tongue on the affected side, affecting speech and swallowing. Hematoma/Seroma Formation: Accumulation of blood or fluid in the surgical site might necessitate drainage and could delay healing. Scar Formation: Any surgery leaves a scar, although efforts are made to minimize its visibility by placing the incision in a natural skin crease. Salivary Fistula: Rarely, a connection might form between the surgical site and the skin, allowing saliva to leak externally. This usually heals over time but might need further treatment. Dry Mouth (Xerostomia): Removal of the submandibular gland, while only partially contributing to the oral saliva production, might contribute to a sensation of dry mouth. Recurrent or Persistent Symptoms: If any part of the gland or a stone is inadvertently left behind, or if sialadenitis was also present in other glands, symptoms might recur or persist.",

      question: "How do you perform your submandibular gland excision?",
      sample_answer: "Under general anesthesia, the patient is positioned supine with neck extended and head turned away from the operative side for optimal exposure. A horizontal incision is made in a skin crease, at least 3cm below the mandible or at the level of the hyoid bone, extending from the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle towards the midline. This minimizes the risk of damaging the marginal mandibular nerve and improves cosmetic outcomes. Exposing the Gland: The platysma and superficial layer of the deep cervical fascia are incised to reveal the submandibular gland. Subcapsular dissection is initiated to minimize the risk of nerve injury. Identifying Key Structures: Careful dissection allows for the identification of the marginal mandibular nerve, which runs within the fascial layers overlying the gland. The facial artery and vein, emerging medial to the posterior belly of the digastric muscle, are identified early to prevent excessive bleeding and ensure nerve safety. Managing the Facial Vessels: The facial vessels are ligated and divided close to the gland, taking care not to injure the marginal mandibular nerve. This step precedes the manipulation of the submandibular duct and the lingual nerve to minimize bleeding and provide a clear view of the surgical field. Duct and Nerve Preservation: The submandibular duct and the branch of the lingual nerve to the submandibular ganglion are clamped, divided, and ligated, ensuring the preservation of the lingual nerve. Final Dissection and Gland Removal: With the key structures identified and preserved, and the facial vessels managed, the gland is carefully dissected free from the surrounding tissues, including the mylohyoid muscle. The hypoglossal nerve, lying medial to the gland and traversing the submandibular triangle, is carefully preserved. Closure: After ensuring complete hemostasis and placing a drain if necessary, the surgical site is closed in layers with appropriate sutures for the platysma and skin.",

      question: "Tell me about sjogrens syndrome.",
      sample_answer: "Sjögren’s Syndrome is an autoimmune disease characterized by the infiltration of lymphocytes into exocrine glands, primarily the salivary and lacrimal glands, leading to dry mouth (xerostomia) and dry eyes (keratoconjunctivitis sicca). It has a higher prevalence in women than in men, showing a male-to-female ratio of approximately 1:9. The syndrome can manifest in any age group but is most commonly diagnosed in middle age. Sjögren’s Syndrome can occur as a primary condition or secondary to other autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus. The primary form involves glandular symptoms of dryness, while the secondary form is associated with other autoimmune disease manifestations. Diagnosis relies on a combination of clinical symptoms, serological markers, and biopsy findings. The American-European Consensus Group’s criteria for diagnosis include ocular symptoms (persistent dry eyes for more than 3 months, use of tear substitutes more than three times a day), oral symptoms (feeling of dry mouth, frequent drinking of water to aid in swallowing), objective evidence of ocular involvement (positive Schirmer's test or Rose Bengal score), evidence of salivary gland involvement (reduced salivary flow rates or abnormal salivary scintigraphy), histopathology showing focal lymphocytic sialadenitis, and autoantibodies (Anti-SSA/Ro and Anti-SSB/La antibodies). Management is symptomatic and supportive, focusing on alleviating dryness symptoms. This includes the use of artificial saliva and tear substitutes, systemic muscarinic agents like pilocarpine or cevimeline to stimulate glandular secretion, and regular dental care to prevent caries and oral infections due to saliva deficiency. Immunosuppressive therapy may be considered for patients with systemic manifestations. Regular monitoring for complications such as lymphoma, which Sjögren’s patients are at increased risk for, is crucial.",
