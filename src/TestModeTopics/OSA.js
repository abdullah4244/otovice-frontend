      question: "What are the indications for tonsillectomy?",
      sample_answer: "The indications for tonsillectomy fall into several key categories, including recurrent acute tonsillitis as defined by the Paradise criteria (seven or more well-documented episodes in a year, five or more such episodes per year for two consecutive years, or three or more such episodes per year for three consecutive years), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) due to adenotonsillar hypertrophy, asymmetrical tonsil hypertrophy suggestive of malignancy, part of another procedure like uvulopalatopharyngoplasty, or history of peritonsillar abscess. These indications reflect both the potential for significant impact on quality of life and the need for histological examination in certain cases.",
    },
    {
      question: "What are the contraindications for tonsillectomy?",
      sample_answer: "Contraindications for tonsillectomy include a recent episode of tonsillitis, peritonsillar abscess or upper respiratory tract infection within the past two weeks, known bleeding disorders, leukemia, agranulocytosis and existing cleft palate.",
    },
    {
      question: "What would you inquire about during your history taking for a child referred with sleep apnea?",
      sample_answer: "I would ask about: nighttime symptoms including snoring, choking, gasping, observed apneas, restless sleep, and changes in sleeping position like head extension backward. Daytime symptoms such as bed-wetting after a period without incidents, performance and behavioral issues at school, and sleepiness. Also, the child's sleep routine, including bedtimes and waking times, and any previous medical history or medication use. These questions aim to identify symptoms of SDB and OSA, assess the severity and impact on daily life, and rule out other conditions.",
    },
    {
      question: "What would you look for during your examination for a child referred with sleep apnea?",
      sample_answer: "I would look for: signs during the oropharyngeal examination such as tonsillar hypertrophy (grading according to a standard scale like Brodsky), dental health, and the Mallampati score to assess airway visibility. Additionally, I'd evaluate body mass index (BMI) for obesity, check for craniofacial abnormalities, perform a nasopharyngoscopy for adenoid size, and assess nasal and lower airway patency. These examinations help to ascertain the physical contributors to OSA, like adenotonsillar hypertrophy and anatomical variations.",
    },
    {
      question: "What investigations would you undertake for a child referred with sleep apnea?",
      sample_answer: "I would: recommend polysomnography as the gold standard for diagnosing OSA, which assesses various physiological parameters during sleep. Additionally, I might consider simpler tests like overnight pulse oximetry or CO2 monitoring in settings where PSG is not available or to prioritize cases. These investigations provide objective data on sleep disruption and oxygen desaturation, crucial for diagnosing OSA and assessing its severity",
    },
    {
      question: "What is a the difference between sleep disordered breathing and OSA?",
      sample_answer: "Sleep Disordered Breathing (SDB) is a broad term that includes various abnormal breathing patterns during sleep, from simple snoring to more severe conditions. Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is a specific type of SDB characterized by repeated episodes of complete or partial airway obstruction during sleep, leading to breathing pauses, oxygen drops, and disrupted sleep.",
    },
    {
      question: "What are the criteria to diagnose OSA in children?",
      sample_answer: "The diagnosis of OSA in children is based on a combination of clinical presentation and findings from sleep studies. The apnea-hypopnea index is used, with mild OSA defined as an AHI of 1 to <5 events/hour, moderate as 5 to <10 events/hour, and severe as â‰¥10 events/hour. Diagnosis also considers symptoms like snoring, daytime sleepiness, and behavioral issues, alongside objective sleep study results.",

      question: "You decide to perform an adenotonsillectomy for this child with OSA. What are the levels of care available for postoperative care?",
      sample_answer: "After an adenotonsillectomy, the level of postoperative care for a child with OSA varies based on the facility's capabilities, ranging from Level 1 to Level 3 centers: Level 1 refers to Basic care in facilities with general pediatric services, suitable for children with straightforward cases of OSA and no serious comorbidities. Level 2 are district general hospitals which Offer more specialized care, including a pediatric High Dependency Unit (HDU) for closer monitoring, ideal for children with moderate OSA or minor comorbidities. Level 3 are Tertiary centers with the highest level of specialized care, including Pediatric Intensive Care Units (PICU) for children with severe OSA and significant comorbidities, ensuring the most comprehensive postoperative monitoring and care.",
    },
    {
      question: "What factors will determine whether you will operate on the child in a DGH or tertiary centre?",
      sample_answer: "I would determine the appropriate level of care based on several key criteria: Age, weight, severity of OSA and comorbidities. Level 1 Centres are Suitable for children over 3 years old and over 14kg, with mild to moderate OSA and no significant comorbidities. This setting is ideal for straightforward cases expected to have an uncomplicated postoperative course. Level 2 Centres are appropriate for children as young as 2 years, weighing more than 12kg. It can manage moderate to severe OSA cases, including those with manageable comorbidities. It provides access to pediatric High Dependency Units (HDUs) for closer postoperative monitoring. Level 3 Centres are Best for managing severe OSA in children with significant comorbidities, such as obesity, neuromuscular disorders, down's syndrome or craniofacial abnormalities.",

    {
      question: "What are the complications of adenotonsillectomy?",
      sample_answer: "Complications can include immediate risks like bleeding (primary within 24 hours and secondary 5-10 days post-op), infection, and reactions to anesthesia. Other complications are dehydration, postoperative pain, orodental trauma, velopharyngeal insufficiency, and rarely, more serious issues like pulmonary edema or atlantoaxial subluxation. Long-term complications may involve persistent or recurrent OSA, especially in children with obesity or other comorbidities, necessitating further evaluation and treatment.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is the role of sleep studies in children suspected of having OSA?",
      sample_answer: "Sleep studies, particularly polysomnography (PSG), are integral in diagnosing OSA in children. They provide a comprehensive assessment of the child's breathing, oxygen levels, and sleep architecture during sleep. This detailed information helps confirm the presence of OSA, assess its severity, and guide treatment decisions. While PSG is the gold standard, the availability and cost might limit its use in some settings. Therefore, alternative assessments like overnight pulse oximetry might be used for screening purposes. However, these alternatives have limitations and might not fully capture the complexity of OSA. The role of sleep studies extends beyond diagnosis; they are also crucial in postoperative evaluations to confirm the resolution of OSA or to identify persistent or residual disease.",
