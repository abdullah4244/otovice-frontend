      question: "What is your differential diagnosis for a child presenting with stridor?",
      sample_answer: "My differential diagnoses for a child presenting with stridor would include: Laryngomalacia: Most common cause, typically presents within the first few weeks of life. Vocal Cord Paralysis: May be congenital or acquired, presenting with inspiratory or biphasic stridor. Subglottic Stenosis: Could be congenital or acquired, often presenting with biphasic stridor. Subglottic Hemangioma: Presents with biphasic stridor, may have a cutaneous hemangioma. Tracheomalacia: Presents after 3 months of age with biphasic stridor, and may include wheezing and cough. These categories help differentiate the cause based on the age of onset, the nature of stridor, and associated symptoms.",
    },
    {
      question: "What would you inquire about during your history taking for this patient?",
      sample_answer: "Timing/onset of symptoms: Immediate onset post-birth suggests congenital causes like subglottic stenosis, while a few weeks to months suggests laryngomalacia. Positioning effects on symptoms: Symptoms worsening in supine position indicate laryngomalacia. Feeding issues: Difficulties, such as prolonged feeding times or choking, can point to airway obstruction severity. Voice and cry quality: A normal cry suggests intact vocal cord movement, important in ruling out vocal cord paralysis. Weight gain and growth: Poor weight gain or failure to thrive indicates significant airway or feeding issues. Episodes of cyanosis or apnoea: These suggest severe airway compromise. Symptoms of Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD): Commonly coexists with laryngomalacia and can exacerbate symptoms. This comprehensive history helps in assessing the severity of the condition and planning further management.",
    },
    {
      question: "What would you look for during your examination of this patient?",
      sample_answer: "During examination, I would assess: Stridor characteristics: Noting if inspiratory, to suggest supraglottic obstruction, such as laryngomalacia. Signs of respiratory distress: Such as tachypnoea, retractions, and cyanosis, indicating the severity of airway compromise. Growth parameters: Evaluating weight for age to assess for failure to thrive. Oral cavity and airway: Looking for anomalies or signs of aspiration. Voice quality: Assessing for hoarseness or breathiness that could suggest vocal cord issues. Flexible Nasoendoscopy (FNE): Directly assesses laryngeal anatomy, movement, and dynamic collapse characteristic of laryngomalacia. These findings guide the diagnosis and help evaluate the severity of the airway compromise.",
    },
    {
      question: "What investigations would you undertake for this patient?",
      sample_answer: "I would consider Polysomnography: For suspected sleep-disordered breathing or severe cases, to evaluate the impact on oxygenation and ventilation. Barium swallow and pH monitoring: If symptoms of GERD are present, to assess for reflux and its potential impact on the airway. Ultrasound of vocal cords: If vocal cord paralysis is suspected, to evaluate cord movement. These investigations provide a comprehensive assessment of the airway, contributing conditions, and guide management strategies.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is laryngomalacia?",
      sample_answer: "Laryngomalacia is the most common cause of stridor in infants, characterized by the collapse of supraglottic structures on inspiration. It typically presents within the first few weeks of life, with symptoms peaking around 6 months and often resolving spontaneously by 2 years. The condition is believed to be due to immature cartilage or neurologic development, and is exacerbated by GERD.",
    },
    {
      question: "How is laryngomalacia classified?",
      sample_answer: "Laryngomalacia can be classified into three types based on the anatomical features observed: Type 1: Shortened aryepiglottic folds causing supraglottic narrowing. Type 2: Presence of redundant supraglottic soft tissue. Type 3: Rarer and associated with neuromuscular disorders; may include prolapse of the epiglottis onto the vocal cords. This classification aids in determining the appropriate surgical approach if needed.",

    {
      question: "How would you manage a 6-month-old presenting with laryngomalacia?",
      sample_answer: "For a 6-month-old with laryngomalacia, management would typically be conservative, including monitoring for growth and feeding difficulties, and managing GERD with proton pump inhibitors or H2 receptor blockers. Surgical intervention, such as supraglottoplasty, may be considered in severe cases exhibiting failure to thrive, significant apnoea, or cyanosis. Parental reassurance about the generally benign course of laryngomalacia is also crucial.",
    },
    {
      question: "What are the surgical options for laryngomalacia?",
      sample_answer: "The primary surgical option for laryngomalacia is supraglottoplasty, which involves: Division or removal of shortened aryepiglottic folds. Reduction of redundant supraglottic tissue. Addressing other structural anomalies contributing to airway obstruction. This procedure aims to alleviate airway obstruction and improve symptoms.",

    {
      question: "What would you tell the parents of a child undergoing MLB and supraglottoplasty surgery during the consent process?",
      sample_answer: "During the consent process, I would explain that Microlaryngobronchoscopy (MLB) and supraglottoplasty are performed to improve airway patency and reduce symptoms of laryngomalacia. I would discuss the risks, including potential for airway edema, bleeding, aspiration, and, though rare, supraglottic stenosis or granulation tissue formation. The benefits include alleviation of stridor, improved feeding and growth, and reduction in apnoeic episodes. It's important to note that most children experience significant improvement post-procedure.",
    },
    {
      question: "Discuss your steps for MLB and supraglottoplasty.",
      sample_answer: "I would begin with Careful patient selection based on clinical severity of laryngomalacia, including failure to thrive, severe stridor, apnea, and feeding difficulties. My preoperative evaluation includes assessing for comorbid conditions, such as GERD and any potential neurologic issues. In theatre, we use General anesthesia with the patient preferably maintaining spontaneous ventilation to accurately assess the dynamic collapse of supraglottic structures. An endotracheal tube may be used initially, then removed or converted to a nasopharyngeal airway to allow for direct access to the larynx during the procedure. I Initiate with a thorough endoscopic examination using a hopkins rod to confirm the diagnosis of laryngomalacia and to rule out other airway anomalies. This includes assessing the vocal cord movement, the presence of redundant arytenoid mucosa, shortened aryepiglottic folds, and the omega-shaped epiglottis. Surgical Technique depends on the abnormality and is in the form of Supraglottoplasty Performed using cold steel instruments, CO2 laser, or a microdebrider, and Aryepiglottic Fold Division to relieve the supraglottic obstruction. This may also include trimming of the excess arytenoid mucosa or the omega-shaped epiglottis if these are contributing to airway obstruction. It's crucial to be conservative to minimize the risk of postoperative complications such as aspiration or airway stenosis. Postoperatively Patients are typically observed overnight with attention to respiratory status, pain management, and monitoring for signs of airway edema or complication. Administration of steroids (e.g., dexamethasone) may be considered to reduce postoperative swelling. Instructions on continued management of GERD with medication and dietary adjustments are important. I arrange early postoperative follow-up to assess for improvement in symptoms, weight gain, and overall development. Further evaluation may be needed if symptoms persist or if new concerns arise.",

      question: "What are the primary aetiological factors of laryngomalacia?",
      sample_answer: "The primary etiological factors of laryngomalacia include: Neurological factors: An underdeveloped neuromuscular system leading to poor tone and coordination in the larynx. Structural factors: Immature or soft laryngeal cartilage that collapses more easily. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD): Can exacerbate laryngomalacia by causing mucosal edema and further narrowing of the airway.",
    },
    {
      question: "What are the potential consequences of untreated laryngomalacia?",
      sample_answer: "Untreated laryngomalacia can lead to several complications, including: Failure to thrive due to feeding difficulties and increased caloric expenditure from the effort of breathing. Recurrent respiratory infections due to aspiration and chronic irritation of the airway. Severe cases may progress to apnea, cyanosis, and in rare instances, cor pulmonale (right-sided heart failure) due to chronic hypoxia and increased pulmonary vascular resistance.",
    },
    {
      question: "Why does laryngomalacia worsen when the infant is supine or crying?",
      sample_answer: "Laryngomalacia worsens when the infant is supine or crying due to the gravitational effects and increased intra-abdominal pressure, respectively. In the supine position, the lax supraglottic tissues are more likely to collapse into the airway, obstructing airflow. Crying increases abdominal pressure, which in turn increases the negative intrathoracic pressure during inspiration, exacerbating the collapse of the supraglottic tissues.",
    },
    {
      question: "What role does a cardiac history play in evaluating a patient with suspected laryngomalacia?",
      sample_answer: "A cardiac history is essential in evaluating a patient with suspected laryngomalacia for several reasons. First, chronic hypoxia from severe laryngomalacia can lead to cor pulmonale, so a pre-existing cardiac condition may exacerbate this risk. Second, some cardiac conditions may present with symptoms similar to laryngomalacia, such as feeding difficulties and failure to thrive, necessitating a thorough differential diagnosis. Lastly, understanding the cardiac history helps in planning anesthesia and postoperative care, especially if surgical intervention for laryngomalacia is considered.",
