      question: "Please describe this image",
      sample_answer: "This is a T1 weighted coronal section of an MRI scan showing a lesion which involves both sinonasal and intracranial spaces.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is your differential diagnosis for this picture?",
      sample_answer: "My differential diagnosis includes: Epithelial Malignancies such as Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) Sinonasal Undifferentiated Carcinoma (SNUC) Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma Mucosal Melanoma Adenocarcinoma Neuroectodermal/Olfactory tumours such as Olfactory Neuroblastoma also known as Esthesioneuroblastoma. And Non-Epithelial Malignancies such as Rhabdomyosarcoma T-Cell Lymphoma and Metastatic Tumors",
    },
    {
      question: "What would you ask during your history for this patient?",
      sample_answer: "I would ask about: Nasal Symptoms: Nasal congestion, timing, and length - to understand the progression. Anosmia and changes in smell - a key feature, especially for olfactory neuroblastoma. Blood-stained discharge or epistaxis - common in many sinonasal tumors. Orbital and Neurological Symptoms: Proptosis, epiphora, chemosis, diplopia - indicate orbital involvement. Headaches and facial pain - can suggest extension into surrounding structures. Cranial nerve symptoms, especially visual changes - could indicate intracranial extension. Exposure and History: Toxin exposure, woodworking, previous radiation - risk factors for sinonasal cancers. History of allergic rhinitis or chronic infection - to rule out benign causes.",
    },
    {
      question: "What would you look for during your examination of this patient?",
      sample_answer: "I would perform Nasal Examination via anterior rhinoscopy and nasendoscopy loooking for Polypoid, friable irregular masses, especially in the superior nasal vault and Deviation of the nasal septum or other structural anomalies. I would Examine the Oropharynx for palatal involvement. Perform a neck examination to Assess for nodal disease Perform a Cranial nerve examination including visual assessment for optic atrophy or papilledema. I would also look for Signs of Advanced Disease, including Orbital signs such as proptosis or chemosis suggesting orbital invasion. And Signs of intracranial pressure or neurological deficits indicating anterior cranial fossa involvement.",
    },
    {
      question: "What investigations would you undertake for this patient?",
      sample_answer: "I would perform Imaging for Tumor Extent and Characteristics, including CT sinuses for bony anatomy, looking for erosion or remodeling. And MRI for soft tissue detail, orbital and skull base invasion. Following this I would perform EUA + biopsy for histological diagnosis. Additional Imaging for Metastases such as PET-CT may be prudent if distant metastases are suspected. USS Â± FNAC may be helpful for nodal disease assessment.",

      question: "What is olfactory neuroblastoma?",
      sample_answer: "Olfactory neuroblastoma, also known as esthesioneuroblastoma, is a rare malignant tumor arising from the olfactory neuroepithelium. It typically presents with unilateral nasal obstruction, blood-stained discharge, anosmia, and sometimes with facial pain, epiphora, diplopia, and proptosis. It can present with Foster-Kenny syndrome, which is optic atrophy and anosmia secondary to a frontal lobe mass. It is characterized by a bimodal age distribution of 20s and the 50s and 60s, potentially involving the anterior ethmoidal cells, cribriform plate, and extending into the anterior cranial fossa. In terms of behaviour, it tends to expand and resorb bone rather than directly invade it, and has associated cervical or retropharyngeal nodal involvement in up to 40%.",

    {
      question: "Describe a staging system you know for olfactory neuroblastoma.",
      sample_answer: "The Kadish system is commonly used, categorizing the disease into: Group A: Limited to the nasal cavity. Group B: Involves nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses. Group C: Extends beyond these areas. Dulgerov modified it to include lymph node status, providing a more detailed TNM-based classification.",
    },
    {
      question: "What are the treatment options for olfactory neuroblastoma?",
      sample_answer: "Treatment is primarily surgical, aiming for complete resection, often followed by radiotherapy to manage microscopic disease or positive margins. Chemotherapy may be considered for high-grade tumors, positive margins, or advanced disease. The approach can vary from endoscopic surgery for early-stage disease to craniofacial resection for more advanced cases. Neck dissection may be necessary for nodal involvement, and palliative care is considered for non-resectable disease.",
    },
    {
      question: "Tell me about the surgical options and the factors that influence choice.",
      sample_answer: "For olfactory neuroblastoma, surgical strategies vary based on the tumor's characteristics and patient factors: Endoscopic Endonasal Approach (EEA): Ideal for tumors confined to the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses without extensive dural or orbital involvement. EEA allows for direct tumor removal with minimal disruption to surrounding structures, offering a less invasive option with reduced recovery time. Craniofacial Resection (CFR): Employed for advanced tumors invading the anterior cranial fossa, orbit, or requiring complex dural resections. CFR typically involves a bifrontal craniotomy or a lateral rhinotomy incision, allowing for wide access to the tumor and the ability to achieve clear margins, especially in cases of intracranial extension. Lateral Rhinotomy and Midfacial Degloving: Techniques used for accessing the maxillary sinus and ethmoidal tumors. These approaches provide good exposure for tumors with limited anterior cranial fossa involvement but significant sinonasal extension. Factors influencing surgical choice: Tumor Size and Location: The extent of tumor invasion into critical areas such as the orbit, dura, or brain influences the need for more invasive approaches like CFR. Proximity to Critical Structures: Tumors near or involving the orbit, optic nerve, or major blood vessels may necessitate specific incisions or approaches to preserve function and appearance. Patient's Health and Preferences: Considerations include the patient's ability to tolerate extensive surgery and personal preferences regarding potential outcomes and recovery. Surgeon's Expertise: The experience of the surgical team with specific techniques can influence the choice of approach, balancing the goals of complete tumor resection with functional preservation.",

      question: "What are the contraindications to surgery?",
      sample_answer: "Absolute contraindications include invasion into the cavernous sinus, especially involving the internal carotid artery, and massive intracranial extension. Relative contraindications might be the loss of both eyes or the only seeing eye, where surgery's risks outweigh its benefits.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is the prognosis by stage?",
      sample_answer: "The prognosis varies significantly by stage: Kadish A (confined to the nasal cavity) has about a 90% 5-year survival rate, Group B (including paranasal sinuses) around 70%, Group C (beyond nasal cavity and sinuses) approximately 50%, and Group D (with distant metastases) about 30%. The propensity for late recurrences means these patients require long term follow up with imaging and clinical examination and biopsy if necessary.",
