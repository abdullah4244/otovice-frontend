    {
      question: "What is your differential diagnosis for this?",
      sample_answer: "Differential diagnosis for bilateral profound SNHL encompasses a wide range of causes categorized into: Congenital Causes: Genetic syndromes affecting hearing (e.g., Usher syndrome, Pendred syndrome). Non-syndromic genetic hearing loss. Intrauterine infections (e.g., cytomegalovirus, rubella). Infectious Causes: Meningitis leading to labyrinthitis ossificans. Viral infections such as mumps or measles causing inner ear damage. Ototoxicity: Exposure to ototoxic drugs like aminoglycoside antibiotics, cisplatin, or loop diuretics. Traumatic Causes: Bilateral temporal bone fractures. Acoustic trauma from loud noise exposure. Tumors: Bilateral vestibular schwannomas, as seen in Neurofibromatosis Type 2. Autoimmune Diseases: Autoimmune inner ear disease (AIED). Systemic conditions with otologic manifestations like lupus or Cogan's syndrome. Age-Related Causes, that is Presbycusis, typically affecting high frequencies first but can progress to profound loss.",

      question: "What are the criteria for cochlear implantation in adults in the UK according to NICE guidelines?",
      sample_answer: "According to NICE guidelines (TA566, 2019), dults must have profound SNHL, with thresholds at or worse than 80 dB HL at 2 or more frequencies between 500 Hz and 4 kHz, despite a minimum 3-month trial of appropriate hearing aids. A phoneme score of less than 50% on the Arthur-Boothroyd word test at 70 dB SPL indicates inadequate benefit from hearing aids.",

      question: "What are the criteria for cochlear implantation in children in the UK according to NICE guidelines?",
      sample_answer: "NICE guidelines specify that cochlear implantation should be considered where The child demonstrates speech, language, and listening skills that are not appropriate for their age, developmental stage, and cognitive ability. There's also specific consideration for bilateral implantation in children with pre-lingual deafness within 2 years of age, post-lingual deafness up to 10 years after onset, and in cases of meningitis before cochlear ossification.",
    },
    {
      question: "What are the contraindications for cochlear implantation?",
      sample_answer: "Contraindications for cochlear implantation include: Active Chronic Suppurative Otitis Media (CSOM): Surgery to render the ear disease-free must be undertaken before cochlear implantation. Agenesis of the Cochlea: Michel’s aplasia and small internal auditory canal syndrome preclude successful cochlear implantation. Cochlear Ossification: Conditions such as labyrinthitis ossificans post-meningitis may hinder implantation unless a cochlear drill-out or use of a modified electrode array is considered. Retro-cochlear Disease: Conditions like Neurofibromatosis Type 2 (NF2) may require an auditory brainstem implant instead. Absent Cochlear Nerve (CN VIII): If the cochlear nerve is absent, traditional cochlear implantation would not be effective.",
    },
    {
      question: "Components of a Cochlear Implant",
      sample_answer: "A cochlear implant consists of two main components, the external device and the implanted device. The External Device comprises of A Microphone which Captures sound from the environment, and is located above the ear. The Processor, which Processes the sound into digital signals, typically worn behind the ear. The Transmitter which Sends the processed sound signals to the internal device via magnetic coupling. The Implanted Device comprises of Receiver/Stimulator which Receives signals from the transmitter and converts them into electrical impulses. and The Electrode Array which is A multi-channel, usually 12–22 electrodes, device implanted in the cochlea that directly stimulates the cochlear nerve fibers in the spiral ganglion.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do cochlear implants work?",
      sample_answer: "Cochlear implants bypass damaged parts of the ear and directly stimulate the auditory nerve, providing a sensation of sound to individuals with severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss. The process involves: Sound Capture: The external microphone captures sound from the environment. Digital Processing: The processor converts these sounds into digital signals. Signal Transmission: The transmitter, through magnetic coupling, sends these digital signals across the skin to the internal receiver/stimulator. Electrical Impulses: The receiver/stimulator converts the signals into electrical impulses and sends them to the electrode array. Auditory Nerve Stimulation: The electrode array, implanted in the cochlea, stimulates the cochlear nerve fibers, sending signals to the brain where they are interpreted as sound.",

    {
      question: "In a patient with bilateral profound SNHL, how would you decide which side to implant?",
      sample_answer: "The decision on which side to implant in a patient with bilateral profound SNHL involves a multidisciplinary team (MDT) assessment and considers several factors: Residual Hearing: Preference might be given to implanting the worse ear to preserve any residual hearing in the better ear. Ear Connectivity: The ear with the most recent onset of deafness or poorer phoneme scores is often chosen, considering the brain's familiarity with processing auditory input from that side. Anatomical and Functional Considerations: Assessment of cochlear morphology, presence of the vestibulocochlear nerve, and any anatomical anomalies through CT/MRI imaging. Considerations for any physical limitations that may affect the use or maintenance of the implant. Balance and Vestibular Function: Evaluation of any existing balance issues or vestibular function that might influence the choice of ear. Patient Preference: Ultimately, the patient's preference, after being informed of all other considerations, plays a crucial role in the decision-making process.",

      question: "Describe the surgical procedure for placing a cochlear implant.",
      sample_answer: "The surgical placement of a cochlear implant typically involves: Preparation: General anesthesia is administered, and a facial nerve monitor is used to prevent nerve damage. Incision and Flap: A post-auricular incision is made, and a musculoperiosteal flap is raised to access the mastoid bone. Mastoidectomy: A cortical mastoidectomy is performed to create a bone bed for the receiver/stimulator package. Facial Recess and Access to Cochlea: Posterior tympanotomy is drilled to access the round window niche or create a cochleostomy for electrode insertion. Electrode Insertion: The electrode array is inserted into the cochlea via the round window or cochleostomy, aiming for atraumatic insertion to preserve residual hearing. Securing the Implant: The receiver/stimulator package is secured in the bone bed, and the electrode array is stabilized. Wound Closure: The surgical site is closed in layers, ensuring a watertight seal to prevent infection and fluid leakage.",
    },
    {
      question: "What influences your choice between round window insertion versus cochleostomy?",
      sample_answer: "The choice between round window insertion and cochleostomy for cochlear implant surgery is influenced by several key factors: Anatomical Accessibility: The visibility and accessibility of the round window can dictate the choice. A clear round window may favor a round window approach. Preservation of Residual Hearing: Round window insertion is often considered less traumatic, potentially preserving more residual hearing. Surgeon Preference and Experience: Surgeons may prefer one technique over the other based on their familiarity and success rates. Implant Specifications: The design of the electrode array might be better suited to one approach based on the intended angle of insertion and electrode flexibility. Intraoperative Findings: Decisions may be adapted based on the condition of the round window membrane and cochlear anatomy observed during surgery.",

    {
      question: "Of What risks would you counsel a patient before the operation?",
      sample_answer: "Before cochlear implant surgery, patients should be counseled about potential risks, including: General Surgical Risks: Such as reactions to anesthesia, pain, bleeding, and infection. Facial Nerve Injury: Rare but can result in facial paralysis or weakness. Taste Disturbances: Due to chorda tympani nerve injury. Post-operative Vertigo and Tinnitus: Can be temporary or persistent. Dead Ear: Complete loss of residual hearing in the implanted ear. CSF Leak/Meningitis: Rare complications that require immediate medical attention. Implant Failure: Includes both soft and hard failures, necessitating re-implantation in some cases.",
    },
    {
      question: "What distinguishes soft failures from hard failures in the context of cochlear implants?",
      sample_answer: "Soft failures refer to partial malfunctions where the cochlear implant doesn't work as intended but still functions to some extent, often fixable with reprogramming. Hard failures mean the implant stops working entirely, requiring surgical replacement.",
    },
    {
      question: "A patient presents with erythema around their cochlear implant site post-operatively. How would you manage this condition?",
      sample_answer: "Management of post-operative erythema around the cochlear implant site involves: Careful evaluation to distinguish between a simple skin reaction and signs of infection. Checking for pain, swelling, discharge, or fever is crucial. For mild erythema without signs of infection, monitoring and possibly prescribing a topical antibiotic or steroid cream may be sufficient. If an infection is suspected, oral antibiotics targeting skin flora should be initiated promptly. Severe cases or those not responding to initial treatment may require consultation with the implant team, and infectious disease consultants. Rarely, if there's evidence of deep infection or implant exposure, surgical exploration and possibly implant removal may be necessary.",

      question: "In performing cochlear implant surgery, what are the key landmarks for drilling the facial recess?",
      sample_answer: "When drilling the facial recess, also known as the posterior tympanotomy, to gain access to the middle ear and round window niche for cochlear implantation, key anatomical landmarks include: Facial Nerve: The vertical (mastoid) segment of the facial nerve serves as the posterior boundary of the facial recess. Chorda Tympani: This nerve runs parallel to and just anterior to the facial nerve. It should be identified to preserve taste sensation and to provide a boundary for the facial recess. Incus: The short process of the incus serves as an important landmark superiorly. Drilling is done anterior to this structure to access the middle ear space safely.",
    },
    {
      question: "What are your landmarks for your cortical mastoidectomy?",
      sample_answer: "he key landmarks for cortical mastoidectomy include: Temporal Line: The upper boundary of the mastoidectomy, which is the ridge of bone where the temporalis muscle attaches. Mastoid Tip: Serves as a reference for the extent of dissection inferiorly. Sigmoid Sinus: A major venous sinus located posteriorly in the mastoid bone. It's important to identify its location to avoid damaging it during the procedure. Teardrop (posterior tympanic spine): Marks the anterior limit of dissection and indicates the location of the facial nerve canal and the entrance to the middle ear. Antrum: A large air cell that communicates with the middle ear cavity, usually located superiorly and posteriorly; serves as a critical landmark to orient the surgeon during mastoidectomy.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do you identify your round window?",
      sample_answer: "To identify the round window: Access via the Facial Recess: After drilling the facial recess, the surgeon can view the middle ear structures. Location Relative to the Oval Window: The round window niche is located inferiorly and slightly posterior to the oval window, which houses the stapes footplate. Promontory: The bony bulge of the cochlear turn, the promontory, is anterior to the round window niche. The round window membrane is recessed within the niche behind the promontory. Inferior Tympanic Annulus: The round window niche can also be located by tracing the inferior tympanic annulus until the niche is found posteriorly.",
