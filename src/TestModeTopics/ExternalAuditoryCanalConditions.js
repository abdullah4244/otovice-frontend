    {
      question: "What is your differential diagnosis for this image?",
      sample_answer: "This is an otoendoscopic image showing bony encroachments into the external auditory canal. My differential diagnosis would include exostoses and osteomata.",
    },
    {
      question: "Tell me about exostosis",
      sample_answer: "Exostosis, often referred to as surfer's ear, involves benign growths of periosteal bone typically found in the medial aspect of the external ear canal. These growths are usually multiple and can be bilateral, frequently arising from prolonged exposure to cold water. Most cases of exostosis are discovered incidentally during an otoscopic examination, as they tend to be asymptomatic. However, in severe cases, the growths may block the ear canal significantly, leading to issues like keratin accumulation, recurrent external otitis, and occasionally cholesteatoma.",
    },
    {
      question: "What are the important factors on history and examination?",
      sample_answer: "When taking a patient's history, it is important to inquire about potential risk factors such as exposure to cold water, which is linked with the development of exostosis. Key symptoms to ask about include hearing loss, recurrent infections, and issues with wax impaction. It's also crucial to understand any impact these symptoms may have on the patient's social or work life, including their ability to wear hearing aids. During the physical examination, otoscopy is essential to evaluate the ear canal for lesions, assessing their size, base, and whether they are unilateral or bilateral. Additionally, checking for signs of otitis externa and wax impaction is important.",
    },
    {
      question: "How would you investigate a patient with suspected exostosis or osteoma?",
      sample_answer: "Investigation of a patient with suspected exostosis or osteoma would include performing audiometry to assess for conductive hearing loss and considering a CT scan to visualize the bony structures of the ear canal if considering surgical treatments. Swabbing for microbial culture and sensitivity might also be necessary if there's a concurrent infection like otitis externa.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do you treat exostosis?",
      sample_answer: "The treatment of exostosis primarily depends on the symptomatology. In asymptomatic cases, regular monitoring may suffice. For symptomatic cases, particularly those where the canal is significantly obstructed, surgical intervention such as canalplasty using an endoscopic approach might be necessary. Techniques can vary from post-aural to permeatal approaches, especially when multiple exostoses are present.",
    },
    {
      question: "Tell me about osteomas",
      sample_answer: "Osteomas of the ear are true neoplastic growths that usually present as solitary, hard lesions with a pedunculated base, arising from the bone-bone junctions like the tympanosquamous or tympanomastoid suture lines. They can be symptomatic if they become occlusive. There is a genetic component linked with conditions like Gardner's syndrome, where osteomas are associated with colonic polyps and other anomalies due to mutations in the APC gene.",
    },
    {
      question: "Tell me about Gardner's syndrome",
      sample_answer: "Gardner's syndrome, also known as familial adenomatous polyposis, is an autosomal dominant condition characterized by multiple colonic polyps that have a high risk of progressing to colorectal cancer. Patients with this syndrome often develop other growths like osteomas, epidermoid cysts, and can have dental anomalies such as supernumerary teeth. The condition is linked to mutations in the APC gene located on chromosome 5q22.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do you treat osteomas?",
      sample_answer: "Osteomas can often be managed conservatively if they are asymptomatic. Symptomatic osteomas, particularly those causing obstruction, are usually removed surgically, either endoscopically or using a drill. The surgical approach depends on the size and location of the osteoma, with endoscopic methods preferred for less complex cases.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do you perform your canalplasty?",
      sample_answer: "I perform the procedure under General anesthesia due to the extensive drilling and noise that might be uncomfortable for the patient. I Inject lidocaine with adrenaline postauricularly and in the EAC. I perform an incision behind the ear, similar to the approach for a tympanoplasty. This provides wide access and visibility. I then Raise a periosteal flap from the postauricular incision, continuing until it meets the ear canal. Using a LempertÂ’s speculum, I make a posterior transcanal incision over the edge of the exostosis, extending inferiorly to adequately reflect the skin flap laterally. I then Carefully reflect the posterior and anterior ear canal skin flaps to expose the bony exostoses. I Use aluminum strips or similar tools to keep the skin out of the surgical field. For Bone Removal, I use sharp burrs at the outermost areas and switch to diamond burrs as I approach the deeper canal and get near sensitive structures. It is important to Continuously irrigate in order to maintain visibility and prevent thermal injury. As I approach the tympanic membrane, I use silastic sheets to protect the delicate skin and structures. The goal is to drill until the tympanomeatal angle is fully open, preventing any keratin buildup. Finally I Remove the eggshell of bone overlying the tympanomeatal angle carefully with specialized raspatory tools, and then Return the ear canal skin flap to its position, Making relieving cuts if necessary to fit the skin comfortably over the new bony contour of the canal. For Closure and Dressing I Place Gelfoam pledgets soaked in corticosporin over the repositioned skin to aid healing and reduce inflammation and Suture the postauricular incision with appropriate surgical threads.",

    {
      question: "Tell me about Keratosis Obturans",
      sample_answer: "Keratosis obturans results from the abnormal migration of epithelial cells leading to the accumulation of keratin in the deep part of the external auditory canal. This can cause significant inflammation and even bone resorption. Clinically, patients present with acute exacerbations characterized by severe ear pain, discharge, and conductive hearing loss due to the occlusion of the ear canal.",
    },
    {
      question: "How would you treat keratosis obturans?",
      sample_answer: "Treatment for keratosis obturans involves removing the keratin plug to alleviate the obstruction and manage inflammation. This may require pain management and sometimes a general anaesthetic due to the severity of pain. Following removal, topical antibiotic and steroid treatments are used to address any secondary infections and reduce inflammation. Regular debridement and monitoring are recommended to prevent recurrence.",
    },
    {
      question: "Tell me about external auditory canal cholesteatoma",
      sample_answer: "External auditory canal cholesteatoma is characterized by the invasive growth of squamous epithelium into the bone, which can lead to localized osteitis and erosion. This condition often arises spontaneously or from chronic inflammation and previous ear surgeries. It presents with chronic ear pain, discharge, and conductive hearing loss, with the possibility of secondary infections.",
    },
    {
      question: "How would you manage external auditory canal cholesteatoma?",
      sample_answer: "Management involves meticulous debridement of the cholesteatoma and the use of ototopical drops to soften and remove debris. Surgical removal is often necessary, involving canalplasty and the placement of skin grafts or cartilage to replace diseased tissues. This approach helps prevent recurrence and manages the structural damage in the canal.",
    },
    {
      question: "Tell me about medial canal fibrosis?",
      sample_answer: "Medial canal fibrosis, also known as false fun-dus or chronic stenosing otitis externa, is a condition characterized by thick fibrous plugs in the medial external auditory canal, often following chronic inflammation or trauma. This can lead to a conductive hearing loss as the ear canal stenoses, creating a featureless blind sac that ends at the level of the tympanic membrane.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do you investigate a patient with medial canal fibrosis?",
      sample_answer: "Investigation typically involves detailed history taking and physical examination with otoscopy to assess the extent of stenosis. CT imaging of the temporal bone is crucial to evaluate the thickness of the fibrous plug and to assess whether the middle ear is involved, and look for co-existent cholesteatoma.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do you treat medial canal fibrosis?",
      sample_answer: "Treatment involves surgical intervention to remove the fibrotic tissue and widen the bony external auditory canal. This may include the placement of a skin graft to cover any exposed bone and prevent recurrence. Medical management during the inflammatory phase might include treating the underlying cause, but it's generally ineffective once the medial plug has formed. Regular post-operative monitoring and aural toilet are essential to manage and prevent restenosis.",
