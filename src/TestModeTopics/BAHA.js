      question: "What is your differential diagnosis for profound single-sided deafness?",
      sample_answer: "Differential diagnosis for single-sided deafness includes several categories, such as: Congenital Causes: Intrauterine CMV infection, Enlarged vestibular aqueduct, cochlear abnormalities, and cochlear nerve deficiency Infectious Causes include mumps and bacterial meningitis. Exposure to ototoxic medications such as aminoglycoside antibiotics, systemic chemotherapy, macrolides, and loop diuretics. Traumatic Causes such as Temporal bone fractures or iatrogenic during surgery. Tumours such as vestibular schwannoma or CPA meningiomas. Autoimmune diseases such as Cogan's Syndrome and Autoimmune inner ear disease. And Environmental Risk Factors such as prematurity, hyperbilirubinemia, noise exposure, or the presence of middle ear effusion, trauma, and ossicular malformations should also be considered.",
    },
    {
      question: "What are the indications for BAHA?",
      sample_answer: "Indications for Bone Anchored Hearing Aid (BAHA) include: Conductive or mixed hearing loss, especially if bone conduction thresholds are significantly better than air conduction thresholds. Single-sided deafness (SSD), with alternatives being CROS or BiCROS devices. Situations where a conventional air conduction aid is unsuitable due to anatomy or recurrent infections, including absence or malformation of the pinna or canal.",
    },
    {
      question: "What are the contraindications for BAHA?",
      sample_answer: "Contraindications for BAHA include: Bone disease resulting in insufficient skull thickness (e.g., osteogenesis imperfecta). Children under the age of 4-5 years due to inadequate skull thickness for osseointegration. Chronic skin disorders around the implantation site. Relative contraindications include psychological immaturity, alcohol/drug abuse, or inability to care for the device.",
    },
    {
      question: "What are the types of BAHA?",
      sample_answer: "Types of BAHA include: Percutaneous: Involves a titanium screw that osseointegrates into the skull bone with an external abutment for the sound processor. Transcutaneous Passive: Uses a magnetic attachment through the skin to connect the external component to the internal component without a percutaneous abutment. Transcutaneous Active: Similar to passive but includes an internal vibrating actuator to improve sound transmission.",
    },
    {
      question: "What type of BAHA is this? Please name the components.",
      sample_answer: "This is a transcutanous active BAHA. It consists of three main components, The Internal Implant which consists of an internal receiver and a bone conduction vibrator. This component is surgically placed under the skin on the skull bone behind the ear. It receives the sound signals from the external processor via magnetic induction and then converts these signals into mechanical vibrations. The External Sound Processor contains a microphone, amplifier, and speaker. It captures environmental sounds and processes them into electronic signals. The sound processor is held in place over the internal implant by magnetic attraction through the skin. Magnetic Attachment: Both the internal implant and the external sound processor have corresponding magnets. The external processor's magnet attaches to the skin over the internal magnet, holding the processor securely in place without the need for a direct skin-penetrating abutment. This design significantly reduces the risk of skin irritation and infection associated with percutaneous systems.",
    },
    {
      question: "What about this BAHA?",
      sample_answer: "This is a percutaneous BAHA. It comprises three main components: The Titanium Fixture, is a small titanium screw that is surgically implanted into the skull bone behind the ear. The fixture osseointegrates with the bone over time, providing a stable base for the attachment of the external components. The abutment is a post that screws into the titanium fixture and protrudes through the skin. It serves as the connection point for the sound processor. The design of the abutment is such that it minimizes skin irritation and allows for an easy clip-on attachment of the sound processor. The Sound Processor is the external component that clips onto the abutment. It contains a microphone, amplifier, and speaker. The sound processor captures sound from the environment, processes it, and transmits the sound vibrations through the abutment and titanium fixture directly to the bone. These vibrations are then conducted to the cochlea, bypassing the outer and middle ear.",
    },
    {
      question: "What about this one?",
      sample_answer: "This is a passive transcutaneous BAHA. It consists of: An Internal Implant surgically implanted under the skin and attached to the bone. However, it does not contain an internal actuator. It will be attached to an internal magnet. An External Sound Processor which captures sound, processes it, and then uses an induction loop to transmit the sound signals through the skin to the internal implant. And an external magnet which is attached to the external sound processor and interacts with the internal magnet of the internal implant through the skin. This magnetic coupling holds the external sound processor in place on the outside of the skin directly over the internal implant.",
    },
    {
      question: "What factors affect osseointegration?",
      sample_answer: "Factors affecting osseointegration include: The quality and quantity of the bone where the implant is placed. The presence of inflammation or infection at the implant site. The material properties of the implant, primarily titanium due to its biocompatibility and strength. Surgical technique, ensuring minimal heat generation during drilling and proper implant placement.",
    },
    {
      question: "At what age is BAHA surgery typically considered for children, and why is there a recommended age?",
      sample_answer: "BAHA surgery is typically considered for children at the age of 4-5 years. This recommended age allows for the skull bone to thicken to approximately 4 mm, which is considered adequate for successful osseointegration and reduces the risk of fixture loss.",
    },
    {
      question: "Are there any special considerations or precautions when placing BAHA implants in children with microtia?",
      sample_answer: "Yes, special considerations for patients with microtia include: Coordinating with a multidisciplinary team for optimal implant placement without interfering with future reconstructive surgery options. Preserving the integrity and vascular supply of post-auricular skin and tissue that might be used in reconstruction. and Adjusting the placement of the implant to accommodate for anatomical variances and future cosmetic procedures.",

    {
      question: "What is the role of middle ear implants in the treatment of hearing loss and how do they differ from BAHAs?",
      sample_answer: "Middle Ear Implants directly stimulate the ossicular chain or cochlear fluids, making them suitable for a wider range of hearing losses including mild to severe sensorineural, conductive, and mixed hearing loss. MEIs are fully or partially implantable devices that do not require an external component like hearing aids. In contrast, BAHAs bypass the middle ear entirely, transmitting sound vibrations through the skull bone to stimulate the cochlea but are limited to hearing loss up to 65 DBHL. MEIs are more discreet and avoid the occlusion effect, but they require intact middle ear structures for optimal function, unlike BAHAs.",
    },
    {
      question: "What are the components of a middle ear implant?",
      sample_answer: "A Middle Ear Implant (MEI) consists of the following components: Internal Receiver/Stimulator: This surgically implanted component receives the signal from the external sound processor. It converts the signal into mechanical vibrations. The receiver is often positioned under the skin behind the ear. Vibrating Ossicular Prosthesis or Actuator: Connected to the internal receiver/stimulator, this component directly drives one of the ossicles (e.g., the incus or stapes) or the round window membrane of the cochlea, depending on the design of the implant. External Sound Processor: Worn behind the ear, this device captures sound and converts it into electrical signals that are transmitted to the internal receiver. It functions similarly to a hearing aid but leverages the implanted components to stimulate the auditory system. Transmitting Coil: This external component, which may be integrated into the sound processor or be a separate piece, uses a magnetic field to wirelessly transmit the processed sound signals to the internal receiver/stimulator. Power Source: Both the external sound processor and the internal receiver/stimulator require power. The external processor is typically powered by batteries, while the internal component may be powered through inductive charging from the external processor.",

    {
      question: "How is the surgical placement of a BAHA performed, and what are the key considerations in selecting the implant site?",
      sample_answer: "Surgical placement of a BAHA involves: Choosing an optimal site, typically 5-6 cm posterior to the ear canal, in an area with adequate bone thickness and avoiding critical anatomical structures. Performing a small incision or using a punch technique to access the bone, followed by drilling and insertion of the titanium implant. Ensuring minimal tissue disruption and preserving vascular supply for better healing and reduced infection risk. Consideration of patient-specific factors, such as skull thickness, skin health, and potential for future procedures.",

    {
      question: "A patient comes to you with erythema around their implant site. How would you manage this?",
      sample_answer: "Management of erythema around the implant site follows the Holger classification: Grade I (Erythema without other symptoms): Initiate meticulous cleaning with mild antiseptic solutions and observe for improvement. Grade II (Erythema and moistness): Consider adding topical antibiotics and ensure the patient is correctly cleaning the area. Grade III (Granulation tissue): Treatment may include removal of granulation tissue, application of silver nitrate sticks, and possibly oral antibiotics if infection is suspected. Grade IV (Skin complications requiring implant removal): Rarely, if conservative management fails and infection is severe, implant removal may be necessary.",
