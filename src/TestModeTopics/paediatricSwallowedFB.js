      question: "You are called to the pediatric emergency department to see a 2-year-old child with sudden onset of drooling and refusal to eat. What is your differential diagnosis?",
      sample_answer: "In a 2-year-old child presenting with sudden onset of drooling and refusal to eat, the differential diagnosis would include a range of conditions that can affect swallowing and oral intake, including: Foreign Body Ingestion: Given the age and symptoms, this is highly suspicious for a foreign body ingestion, particularly an esophageal foreign body. Button batteries, coins, small toys, or food pieces are common culprits. Infectious Causes: Viral or bacterial infections leading to sore throat, tonsillitis, or retropharyngeal abscess can cause pain and reluctance to swallow. Drooling may indicate severe throat pain or inability to swallow saliva. Airway Foreign Body: Although more likely to cause respiratory symptoms, an airway foreign body can sometimes present with drooling and refusal to eat due to discomfort or fear of aggravating coughing or choking. Oropharyngeal Lesions: Ulcerative lesions from conditions such as herpangina, hand, foot, and mouth disease, or candidiasis can make swallowing painful. Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD): Although less likely to cause acute onset symptoms, GERD can cause esophagitis that may suddenly become symptomatic enough to refuse eating. Caustic Ingestion: Ingestion of caustic substances can cause immediate pain and injury to the oral mucosa, esophagus, and stomach, leading to drooling and refusal to eat. Epiglottitis: A less common but serious condition, characterized by fever, drooling, difficulty breathing, and a preference for sitting in an upright position. This is a medical emergency. Dental Problems: Toothaches or gingivitis can also lead to refusal to eat, though they are less likely to cause drooling. Trauma: Trauma to the mouth, throat, or esophagus, such as burns from hot liquids or physical injury, could also present with these symptoms. Psychological Factors: Anxiety or fear related to eating due to a recent choking episode or other traumatic event, though this would not typically cause drooling.",

      question: "What detailed history would you gather in this scenario?",
      sample_answer: "In this scenario, it's important to gather a comprehensive history that includes: The timeline of symptom onset. Any witnessed ingestion of small objects or access to such items. Previous episodes of similar symptoms or foreign body ingestion. Recent illnesses or symptoms suggesting an upper respiratory infection that could mimic foreign body ingestion. Any history of playing with or access to batteries, particularly button batteries. Eating and drinking behavior changes. History of drooling or difficulty swallowing in the past. Any attempts at removing the object at home or prior medical interventions. The child’s medical history, including known allergies, previous surgeries, or esophageal anomalies.",

    {
      question: "The history reveals the child was playing with small household objects and suddenly became distressed, with drooling and difficulty swallowing. What examination findings might you expect if the child has ingested a button battery?",
      sample_answer: "Examination findings in a child suspected of ingesting a button battery might include: Signs of respiratory distress such as stridor, wheezing, or retractions if the battery is causing airway compression. Absence of foreign bodies in the oral cavity upon inspection, yet symptoms suggesting obstruction. Possible signs of discomfort or pain on attempting to swallow saliva. Tachycardia or other signs of distress. Lack of findings on abdominal examination, as the ingestion is recent and symptoms are primarily due to esophageal obstruction.",
    },
    {
      question: "What investigations would you perform in suspected esophageal button battery ingestion?",
      sample_answer: "Investigations should include: Immediate lateral neck and chest radiographs to identify the presence and location of a radio-opaque foreign body, such as a button battery. If the battery's presence is confirmed or highly suspected but not visible on X-ray, further imaging like a CT scan may be warranted to precisely locate the battery and assess any potential damage. Consideration of blood tests to evaluate the overall health and readiness for potential anesthesia or surgery, although the primary focus remains on localizing the foreign body through imaging.",
    },
    {
      question: "What specific findings on a chest X-ray or other imaging studies would suggest the presence of an esophageal button battery?",
      sample_answer: "Specific imaging findings indicating an esophageal button battery include: A double-ring or halo sign on the anteroposterior view on X-ray, distinctive of a button battery. On the lateral view, a step-off at the separation between the anode and cathode of the battery, distinguishing it from other round objects like coins. Location of the foreign body at common sites of esophageal narrowing or impaction, such as the cricopharyngeus muscle, aortic arch level, or near the lower esophageal sphincter. Evidence of airway compression or shift of mediastinal structures if the battery is causing significant swelling or damage.",
    },
    {
      question: "How would you manage this child?",
      sample_answer: "Managing a child suspected of having ingested a button battery requires prompt, coordinated care due to the high risk of rapid and severe complications. After assessment and diagnosis, I would organised prompt endoscopic retrieval of the battery under GA. I would consider Application of honey or sucralfate as first aid if the ingestion is recent (<12 hours) and the child is over one year old, to mitigate damage until removal, only if no signs of esophageal perforation or mediastinitis are present. In theatre I would use a paediatric rigid oesophagoscope to retrieve the battery and assess for oesophageal injury. Post-removal I would admit the patient for monitoring for signs of complications such as esophageal perforation, infection, or stricture formation, with appropriate interventions including antibiotics, corticosteroids, or surgical intervention as needed. Long-term follow-up might be required for surveillance of potential stricture formation or other delayed complications.",

    {
      question: "How do button batteries cause damage?",
      sample_answer: "Button batteries cause damage through: Electrical discharge generating hydroxide ions at the negative pole, causing localized chemical burns. Leakage of alkaline contents, leading to liquefaction necrosis. Pressure necrosis due to physical obstruction and pressure on the mucosal tissue. In case of prolonged contact, deeper tissue penetration and possible perforation due to continuous electrical discharge and chemical exposure.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is the difference in injury caused by alkali and acidic agents?",
      sample_answer: "Alkali agents cause liquefaction necrosis, leading to deeper and more severe damage due to saponification and dissolution of tissue. Acidic agents, on the other hand, cause coagulation necrosis, creating a coagulum that limits the penetration of the acid, typically resulting in more superficial damage.",
    },
    {
      question: "Detail the stages of esophageal caustic injury.",
      sample_answer: "Stages of esophageal caustic injury include: <24 Hours: Initial necrosis with dusky mucosa and possible ulceration. 2–5 Days: Inflammatory phase with grayish coagulum formation. 5–7 Days: Sloughing of the necrotic superficial layer. 1 Week: Beginning of fibrosis, with deep tissue starting to form scars and potential strictures. 2–5 Weeks: Maturation of fibrosis and contraction of the scar tissue, leading to stricture formation.",
    },
    {
      question: "Detail the degrees of esophageal burn.",
      sample_answer: "Esophageal burns are classified as: First Degree: Superficial, affecting only the mucosa with mild symptoms. Management involves observation and possibly antireflux medication. Second Degree: Involves the mucosa and submucosa, possibly extending to the muscle layer; characterized by white exudate and erythema. Requires close observation, may need a nasogastric tube for nutrition, and consideration for steroids and antibiotics. Third Degree: Full-thickness injury extending beyond the esophagus to surrounding tissues; presents with deep necrosis. Immediate management may require airway protection, esophagectomy, or gastrectomy in severe cases, followed by long-term antibiotics and consideration for surgery to address strictures and other complications.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is the Zargar classification?",
      sample_answer: "The Zargar classification categorizes caustic injuries to the esophagus based on endoscopic findings: Grade 0: No visible injury. Grade I: Mucosal edema and hyperemia without ulcers. Grade IIa: Superficial, non-circumferential ulcers, and erosions. Grade IIb: Deep, circumferential ulcers. Grade IIIa: Small areas of necrosis. Grade IIIb: Extensive necrosis. Grade IV: Perforation of the esophagus.",
