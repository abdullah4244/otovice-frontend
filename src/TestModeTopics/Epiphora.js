      question: "What is your differential diagnosis for epiphora?",
      sample_answer: "For epiphora, I would consider a broad differential diagnosis categorized into issues related to excessive tear production and impaired tear drainage: Excessive Tear Production: Infections: Conditions like dacryocystitis and blepharitis can lead to inflammation and increased tear production. Inflammatory Disorders: Diseases such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), Sjögrens syndrome, and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) can cause inflammation of the lacrimal gland, increasing tear production. Trauma: Injury to the eye or surrounding structures can stimulate excessive tear production. Neurological Causes: Aberrant nerve regeneration following cranial nerve VII palsy could lead to inappropriate tear secretion. Allergic Reactions: Allergies affecting the eye area may increase tear production due to irritation. Impaired Drainage: Traumatic Causes: Previous facial fractures may disrupt the normal anatomy of the tear drainage system. Iatrogenic Causes: Surgeries near the eye or nose, such as endoscopic sinus surgery, can inadvertently damage the nasolacrimal system. Obstructive Pathologies: Tumors or other masses in the lacrimal sac or nasolacrimal duct can physically block tear drainage.",

      question: "What would you inquire about during your history taking for this patient?",
      sample_answer: "In taking the history of a patient presenting with epiphora, I would focus on: Symptom Onset and Duration: Understanding when the symptoms started and their progression helps differentiate between acute and chronic causes. Symptom Characteristics: I would ask about any association with allergens or seasonal variations, which might suggest an allergic cause. Additionally, any relation to eating (gustatory tearing) could indicate aberrant nerve regeneration. Associated Symptoms: Querying the presence of mucoid discharge could suggest conjunctivitis; visual symptoms such as blurring might indicate corneal involvement (e.g., keratitis). Past Medical History: Important to note any history of trauma, previous eye or sinus surgeries, or radiation therapy, which could affect tear drainage. Medication History: Some medications like pilocarpine or chemotherapeutic agents could influence tear production or drainage.",

      question: "What would you look for during your examination of this patient?",
      sample_answer: "During the examination, I would systematically assess: Facial Examination: Check for any scars or anatomical anomalies from past trauma or surgeries that might affect tear drainage. Eye Examination: Check for Obstructive Masses: Particularly in the medial canthus which might indicate a lacrimal sac tumor. Inspect for Signs of Infection: Such as erythema, swelling, or pus which could indicate an infection like conjunctivitis. Eyelid Position: Look for entropion or ectropion which could impair proper tear drainage. Nasal Endoscopy: Evaluate the inferior meatus for signs of obstruction such as masses, crusting, or polyps, and inspect for other nasal abnormalities that might affect tear drainage.",

      question: "What investigations would you undertake for this patient?",
      sample_answer: "Schirmers Test can be used to determine if there is excessive tear production which could lead to overflow. for this test, A small strip of filter paper is placed at the outer third of the lower eyelid. The patient is asked to close their eyes, and after 5 minutes, the amount of the strip moistened by tears is measured. Less than 10 mm of moisture indicates dry eyes, whereas significantly more moisture could suggest excessive tear production. The Fluorescein Dye Disappearance Test assesses how well tears are draining through the nasolacrimal system. A drop of fluorescein dye is instilled into the conjunctival sac. After several minutes, the clinician examines the eye under a blue light to see how much dye remains. Normally, most of the dye should drain away. Persistence of dye in the tear film after 5 minutes suggests a blockage or dysfunction in the tear drainage system. Dacrocystography is used to visualize the lacrimal sac and nasolacrimal duct, identifying blockages or structural anomalies such as diverticula or strictures. An iodine-based contrast dye is injected into the lacrimal puncta after dilating them. X-rays are then taken to trace the flow of the dye through the lacrimal system. This helps identify the location and nature of any obstruction within the ducts. Imaging in the form of MRI/CT are used when a neoplastic cause is suspected or to provide detailed anatomical information about the surrounding tissues and structures that may be affecting the lacrimal system. Jones Tests I and II: These are more specific tests used to assess the patency and function of the lacrimal drainage system. Jones I is a primary dye test to check if the dye passes into the nose without manipulation, indicating a functional system. Jones II involves flushing the system with saline after a negative Jones I to locate the obstruction.",

      question: "Tell me about congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction.",
      sample_answer: "Congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction (CNLDO) typically presents in infants with persistent tearing and discharge due to a failure in the complete canalization of the nasolacrimal duct. Symptoms include increased tear meniscus and mattering or crusting of lashes, often affecting up to 6% of newborns. While many cases resolve spontaneously within the first year of life, persistent symptoms may require intervention. CNLDO is more frequently observed in syndromic conditions like Down syndrome and other developmental disorders.",

      question: "What is a dacryocystocele?",
      sample_answer: "A dacryocystocele, also known as a nasolacrimal duct cyst, forms when both the proximal and distal parts of the nasolacrimal system are obstructed. This condition results in a tense, bluish swelling below the medial canthal tendon and can lead to significant complications such as nasal obstruction and, in severe cases, respiratory distress. It's typically noted at birth or shortly thereafter and requires prompt evaluation and management.",

    {
      question: "What are your medical options for managing epiphora?",
      sample_answer: "Medical management of epiphora depends on the underlying cause: Infective Causes: Appropriate antibiotic or antiviral therapy for conditions like conjunctivitis or dacryocystitis. Allergic Reactions: Antihistamines or other anti-allergy medications might be useful. Dry Eye Syndrome: Lubricating eye drops or ointments, such as Lacrilube or Viscotears, can help alleviate symptoms.",

      question: "What are the surgical options for epiphora?",
      sample_answer: "Surgical treatment options for epiphora include: Punctoplasty: This procedure widens the punctal openings if they are too narrow, facilitating better drainage. Balloon Dacryoplasty: Used to dilate strictures within the nasolacrimal duct. Dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR): This surgery creates a new drainage pathway between the lacrimal sac and the nasal cavity, which can be performed using external or endoscopic approaches.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do you do your DCR?",
      sample_answer: "First, The nasal cavity is prepared with topical decongestants and anesthetics to reduce mucosal bleeding. Using an endoscope, I would locate the lateral nasal wall and identify the middle turbinate. The lacrimal sac is typically located just anterior and lateral to the attachment of the middle turbinate. I would make a vertical incision over the lacrimal sac area on the lateral nasal wall using a sickle knife or a laser, depending on the equipment available and personal preference. Carefully elevate a mucosal flap to expose the underlying bone of the lacrimal fossa. This step is crucial for accessing the lacrimal sac and nasolacrimal duct directly. Using fine bone punches, drills, or Kerrison rongeurs, I would remove the bone covering the lacrimal sac and the upper part of the nasolacrimal duct, creating a bony ostium that is sufficiently large to ensure good drainage. The lacrimal sac is then opened with a vertical incision, and any scar tissue or debris within the sac is cleared out. A direct anastomosis is created between the lacrimal sac and the nasal mucosa, ensuring that the new pathway remains open for tear drainage. This may involve stenting the newly created pathway with silicone tubes to prevent closure during the healing process. The mucosal flaps are then repositioned and secured with absorbable sutures to promote healing. Finally, I would ensure that the anastomosis is patent by irrigating through the lacrimal system and watching for the flow of fluid into the nose. Postoperative care involves monitoring for any signs of infection or excessive bleeding. Nasal packing may be used to control bleeding and is usually removed a day or two after surgery. Patients are usually seen in the clinic a few weeks post-surgery to assess the surgical site and patency of the new tear duct. Silicone stents, if used, are typically removed within a few months after surgery.",

      question: "What are the complications of endoscopic DCR?",
      sample_answer: "Although endoscopic DCR is a relatively safe procedure, it's not without potential complications. Being aware of these helps in managing them effectively if they arise: Hemorrhage: Bleeding is one of the most common complications during and after surgery, usually managed with careful hemostasis and nasal packing. Infection: Postoperative infections can occur, requiring antibiotic treatment. Scarring and Fibrosis: Scarring of the newly created ostium can lead to failure of the procedure. Mitomycin C is sometimes applied intraoperatively to reduce the risk of fibrosis. Incomplete Relief of Symptoms: If the osteotomy is not large enough or if the lacrimal sac is not adequately opened, symptoms of tearing may persist. Injury to Adjacent Structures: There is a risk of damaging nearby structures, such as the nasal mucosa or the turbinates, during surgery. Stent-related Issues: If silicone stents are used, there's a risk of migration or blockage, and their removal can sometimes be challenging. CSF Leak: Although rare, there is a risk of creating a cerebrospinal fluid leak when manipulating the bone near the cribriform plate. Recurrence: There is a possibility of the problem recurring if the duct narrows again over time, especially if underlying issues like chronic inflammation are not addressed.",
