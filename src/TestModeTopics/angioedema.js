      question:
        "The patient has also presented with tongue swelling and difficulty breathing. What is your differential diagnosis?",
      sample_answer:
        "My differential diagnosis would categorize into allergic or nonallergic causes: Allergic Reactions are Immediate hypersensitivity reactions to foods, medications, or insect stings, often accompanied by urticaria or anaphylaxis. Angioedema which can be further divided into Hereditary angioedema, often without urticaria and not responding to antihistamines or corticosteroids, and Acquired angioedema, which may be related to medications (such as ACE inhibitors) or other allergens. Other non-allergic causes include Infections such as ludwig's angina or abscess of the tongue. Trauma by Physical injury or irritation from dental procedures or biting the tongue. Other Causes would be conditions like neoplasms, cysts, or systemic diseases such as amyloidosis or sarcoidosis.",

      question: "What is angioedema and how does it manifest in patients?",
      sample_answer:
        "Angioedema is a condition characterized by the rapid onset of swelling in the deeper layers of the skin and mucous membranes. It can occur anywhere in the body but is particularly concerning when it involves the head, neck, especially the airway, or gastrointestinal tract. Manifestations in patients include swelling of the face, lips, tongue, throat, and extremities, abdominal pain (due to gastrointestinal involvement), difficulty breathing, and voice changes, such as hoarseness or a muffled voice. The condition can arise due to allergic reactions, hereditary factors, or as a side effect of certain medications, notably ACE inhibitors.",

      question: "Can you describe the different types of angioedema?",
      sample_answer:
        "Yes, angioedema can be classified into several types based on its cause, or considered as Hereditary or acquired. Hereditary Angioedema (HAE) is Caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of the C1 esterase inhibitor protein, leading to uncontrolled activation of the complement pathway. This type does not typically respond to antihistamines or corticosteroids. Acquired Angioedema is Similar to HAE in mechanism but is not genetic. It is often associated with autoimmune disorders or lymphoproliferative diseases. Angioedema due to ACE Inhibitors: Results from the accumulation of bradykinin due to the inhibition of its breakdown by ACE inhibitors, a common class of blood pressure medications. Allergic Angioedema: Occurs as part of an allergic reaction, often alongside urticaria (hives) and potentially anaphylaxis. It is typically rapid in onset and may be triggered by foods, insect stings, or medications. Idiopathic Angioedema is When the cause of angioedema cannot be determined despite thorough evaluation.",

      question:
        "How is hereditary angioedema different from acquired angioedema?",
      sample_answer:
        "Hereditary angioedema is a genetic condition caused by mutations leading to deficiency or dysfunction of the C1 esterase inhibitor protein, affecting the complement pathway and resulting in excessive bradykinin production. HAE is characterized by episodes of swelling without urticaria, not responsive to antihistamines, corticosteroids, or epinephrine, and has no identifiable external triggers. Acquired angioedema, in contrast, is often related to an underlying health condition, such as autoimmune diseases, lymphoproliferative disorders, or malignancies, that leads to the acquired deficiency of C1 esterase inhibitor or dysfunction in its pathway. It can also be triggered by certain medications, including ACE inhibitors, NSAIDs, and others that affect the bradykinin pathway or immune system. Environmental factors, including allergens and stress, may also play a role.",

    {
      question: "What are common triggers for acquired angioedema?",
      sample_answer:
        "Common triggers for acquired angioedema include: Medications, notably ACE inhibitors and NSAIDs. Foods, particularly those known to cause allergic reactions like nuts, shellfish, and eggs. Insect stings or bites. Blood transfusions. Infections, including hepatitis B and other viral infections. Physical stress, emotional stress, and possibly environmental allergens.",

      question:
        "How would you investigate a patient presenting with angioedema?",
      sample_answer:
        "For angioedema, I would perform: History and Physical Examination to assess for airway compromise and identify potential causes and triggers. One of the first laboratory tests recommended in the evaluation of angioedema is the C4 complement level. Low levels of C4 are often found in cases of hereditary angioedema (HAE) due to C1 inhibitor deficiency and in acquired angioedema, suggesting activation of the classical complement pathway. Normal levels might indicate types of angioedema not related to C1 inhibitor deficiency, such as those caused by ACE inhibitors or allergic reactions. To further clarify the diagnosis, C1 esterase inhibitor (C1-INH) testing is performed, including both quantitative and functional assays. In hereditary angioedema Type I, the quantity of C1-INH protein is typically low, while in Type II, the C1-INH protein level might be normal or even elevated, but its function is deficient. This differentiation is crucial for establishing the correct type of HAE. Additionally, C1q levels are measured, primarily to help differentiate between hereditary and acquired forms of angioedema. Low C1q levels are more commonly associated with acquired angioedema, often linked to underlying conditions like lymphoproliferative disorders. In cases where allergic angioedema is suspected, specific allergy testing might be conducted to identify reactions to foods, medications, or environmental allergens. Although not routinely performed, ACE levels could be considered if angioedema is suspected to be induced by ACE inhibitors, but the diagnosis is usually based on clinical history. For individuals with HAE with normal C1-INH, where traditional markers are typically within normal ranges, genetic testing may be advised to identify specific mutations associated with the condition, such as those in the factor XII gene.",

      question:
        "What are the main treatment approaches for managing angioedema?",
      sample_answer:
        "The main treatment approaches for angioedema include: Airway Management, with Immediate attention to secure airway patency in severe cases. Discontinuation of Triggering Substances: Such as stopping ACE inhibitors or NSAIDs if implicated. Acute Treatments For allergic angioedema include Antihistamines, corticosteroids, and epinephrine. For HAE and certain acquired types, acute treatment comprises C1 esterase inhibitor concentrates, bradykinin receptor antagonists, and kallikrein inhibitors. Prophylactic Treatments for hereditary types include Androgens, antifibrinolytics, and C1 inhibitor concentrates. Supportive Care in the form of Hydration and pain management may be needed.",

      question: "Discuss the types of hereditary angioedema.",
      sample_answer:
        "Hereditary Angioedema (HAE) is a genetic disorder marked by unexpected and recurrent episodes of severe swelling. This condition is due to mutations affecting the C1 inhibitor (C1-INH) protein, critical for controlling inflammation. Hereditary Angioedema Type I is the most prevalent form, constituting about 85% of cases. It results from mutations in the SERPING1 gene, leading to insufficient production of C1-INH protein. Individuals with this type experience swelling in various body parts, including the limbs, face, and gastrointestinal tract, which can be painful and potentially life-threatening when affecting the airways. Hereditary Angioedema Type II accounts for approximately 15% of HAE cases. Although also caused by mutations in the SERPING1 gene, in this type, the body produces normal or elevated levels of C1-INH protein, but it's dysfunctional. The clinical manifestations are similar to Type I, with episodes of swelling that can significantly impact the quality of life. Hereditary Angioedema with Normal C1-INH encompasses several subtypes linked to different genetic mutations but characterized by normal levels and functioning of C1-INH. These types are due to mutations in genes other than SERPING1, affecting pathways leading to increased bradykinin production, which is the primary cause of swelling in HAE. Patients exhibit similar symptoms to Types I and II, although diagnosis may be more challenging due to the initial exclusion of C1-INH deficiency.",

      question:
        "Let's say he actually was presenting with anaphylaxis. How would you manage them?",
      sample_answer:
        "I would manage them according to ALS principles, removing the trigger if still present and performing an A to E assessment whilst intervening appropriately at each level as well as administering treatment with 500 micrograms of intramuscular adrenaline, which is half a vial of 1 in 1000 adrenaline if an epipen is not available. For Airway I would Check for hoarseness, voice changes, or stridor indicating airway involvement. This would be done in coordination with my anaesthetic colleagues and we would make a plan to secure the patient's airway promptly if required. In terms of Breathing, I would Look for increased work of breathing, wheezing, fatigue, cyanosis, or an oxygen saturation (SpO2) below 94%. We would administer high flow oxygen. For Circulation we would Observe for low blood pressure, signs of shock, confusion, or reduced consciousness, ensuring IV access and resuscitation as required. This would generally be in the form of 500ml crystalloid fluid challenges.",
