      question: "Describe this audiogram",
      sample_answer: "This is a pure tone audiogram showing mild to moderate conductive hearing loss of the right ear with a carhart notch.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is your differential diagnosis for this audiogram?",
      sample_answer: "It includes Ossicular diseases, such as otosclerosis & ossicular fixation or erosion. Mucosal diseases, such as chronic otitis media, leading to conductive hearing loss through effusion, perforation or cholesteatoma. Temporal bone diseases, such as superior semicircular canal dehiscence syndrome, Paget's disease, fibrous dysplasia, or osteogenesis imperfecta. I would also consider Tumors, like jugulotympanic paragangliomas and facial neuromas.",
    },
    {
      question: "What would you ask during your history for this patient?",
      sample_answer: "I would ask about: Age of onset and progression of the hearing loss, noting that otosclerosis typically presents as a progressive condition that may initially be unilateral but often becomes bilateral. Tinnitus, which is reported by 75 to 80% of otosclerosis patients. Vertigo, which may indicate an alternative diagnosis. Paracusis Willisii, the perception of improved hearing in noisy environments, is characteristic of otosclerosis. I would ask about Previous medical history, including relating to pregnancy, as symptoms may deteriorate during pregnancy due to hormonal influences. Lastly, I would ask about Family history of hearing loss or otosclerosis surgery, reflecting the autosomal dominant nature of the condition.",
    },
    {
      question: "What would you look for during your examination of this patient?",
      sample_answer: "I would perform Otoscopy, which is usually normal in otosclerosis. However, Schwartz's sign (a reddish or bluish hue over the promontory due to active otosclerosis) might be visible. I would perform tuning fork testing expecting conductive hearing loss or Reversal of tuning fork tests, particularly a negative Rinne test becoming positive when transitioning from 512 to 1024 Hz, indicative of a significant air-bone gap.",
    },
    {
      question: "You suspect otosclerosis, how do you proceed to investigate the patient?",
      sample_answer: "In addition to the above PTA showing a Carhart's notch at 2 kilohertz and conductive hearing loss, I would perform Tympanometry, expecting to see a Type AS tympanogram indicative of stapes fixation. Stapedial reflex testing would likely show absent stapedial reflexes in otosclerosis. I would perform Speech audiometry, assessing for the speech discrimination score. A score below 60% might indicate cochlear otosclerosis and poor surgical candidacy. I would also perform High-resolution CT scan of the temporal bones, looking for halo sign or otospongiotic foci around the fissula ante fenestram and evaluating the middle ear anatomy for surgical planning.",

    {
      question: "What is Otosclerosis?",
      sample_answer: "Otosclerosis is a metabolic disorder of the bone affecting the otic capsule and ossicles. It involves abnormal bone resorption and deposition, leading to stapes fixation and conductive hearing loss. It has an autosomal dominant inheritance with incomplete penetrance, often presenting in the 30s or 40s, and may be accelerated by pregnancy. The condition may progress from conductive to mixed hearing loss if it involves the cochlea (cochlear otosclerosis).",
    },
    {
      question: "What are your treatment options?",
      sample_answer: "Treatment options include: Conservative management with hearing aids, particularly effective in early or mild cases. Medical treatment with sodium fluoride or bisphosphonates to slow disease progression, though evidence of efficacy is limited. The Surgical option is primarily stapedotomy, where the fixed stapes is replaced with a prosthesis, aiming to improve hearing.",
    },
    {
      question: "Tell me about the surgical approaches",
      sample_answer: "Surgical management of otosclerosis primarily involves stapedotomy, which may be preferred over stapedectomy due to its reduced risk profile and preservation of the stapes superstructure. Stapedotomy involves creating a small opening in the fixed stapes footplate and inserting a prosthesis to restore the ossicular chain's continuity. Alternatives include stapedectomy, where part or all of the stapes footplate is removed. Risks associated with these procedures include: Sensorineural hearing loss Taste disturbance Temporary or persistent vertigo Tinnitus Perilymph fistula and Facial nerve injury",
    },
    {
      question: "What are the expected outcomes of surgery? Do you know any tools useful in assessing these?",
      sample_answer: "The primary expected outcome of surgery for otosclerosis, specifically stapedotomy, is the significant improvement or normalization of conductive hearing loss. Successful surgery is generally defined as closure of the air-bone gap to within 10 dB, which is achieved in approximately 80 to 90% of cases. The Belfast Rule of Thumb and Glasgow Benefit Plots are tools used to evaluate the potential benefit of surgery and to assist in counseling patients regarding the expected outcomes. The Belfast Rule of Thumb suggests operating on the poorer hearing ear first, with the goal of achieving a hearing level of 30 dB HL or better, or within 15 dB of the better ear. The Glasgow Benefit Plot is a graphical representation used to visualize the outcome of binaural hearing post-operatively, aiding in the decision-making process regarding which ear to operate on and when.",

    {
      question: "What are the contraindications to surgery?",
      sample_answer: "Absolute contraindications include active otosclerosis, cochlear otosclerosis, ear infection, Meniere's disease, and malleus ankylosis. Relative contraindications include the only hearing ear, poor pre-operative speech discrimination, and certain occupational hazards such as being a pilot.",
    },
    {
      question: "How would you manage a perilymph gusher intraoperatively?",
      sample_answer: "In the event of a perilymph gusher, the strategy involves elevating the patient's head, sealing the vestibular opening with a graft such as vein patch or fascia, placing the prosthesis as planned, and packing with gelfoam to manage the leak. Additional measures like a lumbar puncture or drain may be considered for high-volume or persistent leaks.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is a carhart notch?",
      sample_answer: "A Carhart notch is a dip in bone conduction thresholds at 2 kiloHertz. It doesn't indicate a true loss in cochlear function at that frequency but rather altered mechanics of sound transmission caused by stapes fixation. The middle ear's natural resonance at 2 kiloHertz means that sound at this frequency is usually transmitted more efficiently; however, when the stapes is immobilized, this transmission is disrupted, creating the apparent notch in bone conduction thresholds.",
