      question: "A patient presents to you with episodes of vertigo. What is your differential diagnosis?",
      sample_answer: "The differential diagnoses can be broadly categorized as: Congenital Causes, including Intrauterine CMV Infection: Leading to sensorineural hearing loss which could present with vertigo. Enlarged Vestibular Aqueduct: Known to cause fluctuating sensorineural hearing loss and balance issues. Cochlear Abnormalities: Such as Mondini dysplasia which may present with vertigo and hearing loss. Cochlear Nerve Deficiency: Affecting auditory and vestibular function, potentially leading to vertigo. Infectious Causes including Mumps which Can cause viral labyrinthitis, presenting with vertigo. Similarly conditions such as acute or chronic otitis media can cause vertigo. Bacterial Meningitis: Known to affect the labyrinth, leading to sensorineural hearing loss and potentially vertigo. Exposure to Ototoxic Medications: Aminoglycoside Antibiotics, particularly gentamicin which is more vestibulotoxic than ototoxic. Systemic Chemotherapy which can have vestibulotoxic effects. Macrolides and Loop Diuretics which Can cause temporary or permanent balance disturbances. Traumatic Causes for example Temporal Bone Fractures which Can disrupt inner ear function leading to vertigo. Iatrogenic causes such as Surgery involving the inner ear can result in vertigo. Tumors like Vestibular Schwannoma and CPA meningiomas which can affect the vestibulocochlear nerve, leading to vertigo And Autoimmune Diseases including Cogan's Syndrome: A rare disorder that can present with interstitial keratitis and vestibular symptoms including vertigo. Autoimmune Inner Ear Disease (AIED): Can present with rapid-onset sensorineural hearing loss and vertigo. As well as miscellaneous conditions such as vestibular migraines.",

      question: "What would you inquire about during your history taking for this patient?",
      sample_answer: "I would ask about: Onset and Duration of Symptoms: To establish the episodic nature of vertigo and its correlation with hearing loss and tinnitus. Pattern of Episodes: Including triggers, duration, frequency, and any preceding aura or fullness sensation. Hearing Loss: Noting if it’s fluctuating and worse during attacks, which supports Ménière’s disease. Otalgia and Otorrhoea: Though less common, may indicate an alternative diagnosis such as middle ear pathology. Systemic Symptoms: Including autoimmune diseases or symptoms suggesting systemic involvement. Medication History: Including use of ototoxic medications. Family History: Suggesting a genetic component. Migraine History: Personal or family history, considering vestibular migraine as a differential. Lifestyle Factors: Including stress, diet (salt intake), caffeine, alcohol use, and smoking. Comorbidities: Autoimmune diseases, allergies, and other conditions that may have vestibular manifestations.",

      question: "What would you look for during your examination of this patient?",
      sample_answer: "I would perform: A full Neurological Examination To rule out central causes of vertigo, including cranial nerve assessment and coordination tests. Otoscopy: To assess for tympanic membrane abnormalities and exclude middle ear pathology. Vestibular Tests: Including Romberg’s, Unterberger’s, and the head-thrust test for signs of peripheral vestibulopathy. Dix-Hallpike Maneuver: To exclude BPPV. Nystagmus Assessment: Observing for spontaneous or evoked nystagmus during vertigo episodes, indicating vestibular involvement. Tuning fork tests like Weber and Rinne, looking for sensorineural hearing loss. Noting any asymmetry in hearing, which may suggest unilateral Ménière’s disease or a vestibular schwannoma.",
    },
    {
      question: "The patient has fluctuating hearing loss, episodes of vertigo and aural fullness. What initial investigations would you undertake for this patient?",
      sample_answer: "I would undertake: Pure Tone Audiometry (PTA): To document low to mid-frequency sensorineural hearing loss, a hallmark of Ménière's disease. Vestibular Function Tests: Including caloric testing to assess for vestibular hypofunction on the affected side. MRI of the Internal Auditory Meatus: To exclude retrocochlear pathology such as acoustic neuroma. Electrocochleography (ECoG): To detect increased SP/AP ratio indicative of endolymphatic hydrops. Vestibular Evoked Myogenic Potentials (VEMPs): To assess saccular and utricular function and their response to sound stimulation.",
    },
    {
      question: "This is your patient's V E M P. Can you tell me what you would expect to see in left Meniere's disease?",
      sample_answer: "There are two types of VEMP tests: cervical VEMP (cVEMP), which assesses the saccule and inferior vestibular nerve function via probes on the sternocleidomastoid muscle, and ocular VEMP (oVEMP), which assesses the utricle and superior vestibular nerve via probes on the Orbicularis oculi. I would expect to see reduced thresholds for the left ear on both cVEMP and oVEMP relative to the contralateral ear, with increased amplitude on the affected side, however this test is not specific.",
    },
    {
      question: "This is your patient's ECOG. Can you tell me how it works and what you would expect to see in left Meniere's disease?",
      sample_answer: "Electrocochleography is used to measure the electrical potentials generated in the cochlea and auditory nerve in response to sound stimulation, usually in the form of clicks or tone bursts delivered through headphones. An electrode is placed typically on the tympanic membrane (eardrum) or in the external ear canal near the tympanic membrane with additional reference and ground electrodes placed on the forehead or scalp. The electrodes pick up electrical responses generated by the hair cells in the form of cochlear microphonics and summating potential, while those from the auditory nerve are reflected in the action potential. The recorded signals are analysed, with the ration of the summating potential to the action potential, known as the SP/AP ration, being of interest in Meniere's disease. In our patient with left Meniere's disease, we would expect the SP/AP ration to be greater than 0.4.",

    {
      question: "What is Ménière's disease?",
      sample_answer: "Ménière's Disease is an idiopathic condition characterized by episodic vertigo, fluctuating sensorineural hearing loss, tinnitus, and aural fullness. It is associated with endolymphatic hydrops, an abnormal fluid accumulation in the inner ear. The condition typically affects adults and can be unilateral or bilateral.",
    },
    {
      question: "What are the variants of Ménière's disease?",
      sample_answer: "Fulminant Meniere's: Presenting with the classic triad of vertigo, hearing loss and aural fullness. Cochlear Hydrops: Presenting with otological symptoms without vertiginous features. Vestibular Hydrops: Exhibiting vertigo without cochlear symptoms, potentially overlapping with vestibular migraine. Lermoyez Syndrome: Where vertigo attacks relieve tinnitus and hearing loss. Tumarkin’s Crisis: Sudden drop attacks without loss of consciousness.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is Ménière's syndrome?",
      sample_answer: "Ménière's syndrome has similar clinical features to Ménière's disease but is secondary to a known cause, such as head trauma, syphilis, or autoimmune disorders, rather than being idiopathic.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is the pathophysiology of Ménière's disease?",
      sample_answer: "The pathophysiology involves endolymphatic hydrops or the abnormal accumulation and regulation of endolymph fluid in the inner ear, leading to distention of the membranous labyrinth. This distention may cause microtears, allowing mixing of endolymph and perilymph, damaging hair cells. Theories suggest overproduction or impaired absorption of endolymph, autoimmune mechanisms, genetic factors, and possible viral infections as underlying causes.",
    },
    {
      question: "How would you treat a patient with Ménière's disease?",
      sample_answer: "Treatment involves a multidisciplinary team (MDT) approach and is stepwise, starting from conservative measures such as Lifestyle Modifications like Salt, caffeine and alcohol reduction with stress management, alongside vestibular rehabilitation, hearing aids and tinnitus retraining therapy. This can be augmented by medical treatments, with Betahistine and diuretics to reduce episodes, vestibular suppressants such as prochlorperazine for acute attacks, and intratympanic steroids or gentamicin for recurrent severe cases. Surgical Options exist for For intractable cases, including endolymphatic sac decompression, vestibular nerve section, and labyrinthectomy, depending on the presence of hearing.",
    },
    {
      question: "What are your considerations when deciding between intratympanic steroids and gentamicin?",
      sample_answer: "Considerations include: Hearing: I prefer steroids in patients where hearing is a priority such as bilateral involvement or the affected ear still has serviceable involvement. In these cases I use 1 vial of 3.3mg/ml dexamethasone, though methylprednisolone at 62.5ml is an alternative. Can lead to a significant reduction in vertigo attacks and, in some cases, improvement in hearing. The response rate is up to 90%, but benefits may be temporary. In patients with incapacitating vertigo, have failed other therapies and particularly if the affected ear has poor or non-serviceable hearing, I would use gentamicin at concentrations of 40mg/ml. This has an up to 85% vertigo control rate with a 5-10% risk of hearing loss, though this increases with repeated administrations.",

      question: "What are the diagnostic criteria for Ménière's disease according to the AAO-HNS?",
      sample_answer: "The revised 2020 diagnostic criteria for Ménière's Disease by the American Academy of Otolaryngology—Head and Neck Surgery (AAO-HNS) Equilibrium Committee, in collaboration with the Classification Committee of the Bárány Society and other international organizations, include: Definite Ménière's Disease: Two or more spontaneous episodes of vertigo, each lasting 20 minutes to 12 hours. Audiometrically documented fluctuating low- to mid-frequency sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) in the affected ear on at least one occasion before, during, or after one of the episodes of vertigo. Fluctuating aural symptoms such as hearing loss, tinnitus, or fullness in the affected ear. Exclusion of other causes through appropriate tests. Probable Ménière's Disease: At least two episodes of vertigo or dizziness lasting 20 minutes to 24 hours. Fluctuating aural symptoms such hearing loss, tinnitus, or fullness in the affected ear. Other causes excluded by other tests. These criteria aim to standardize the diagnosis of Ménière's Disease, facilitating more consistent research and treatment approaches.",

    {
      question: "What is a crisis of Tumarkin?",
      sample_answer: "A Tumarkin's crisis, or drop attack, is a sudden fall without loss of consciousness associated with Ménière's disease. It is due to a sudden and temporary loss of vestibular function on the affected side. It poses significant safety risks, especially concerning driving.",
    },
    {
      question: "Your patient is a school bus driver and has been experiencing drop attacks. What do you advise him?",
      sample_answer: "I would advise him to cease driving and notify the DVLA. If he were experiencing sufficient warning signs before vertigo attacks, he should still inform the DVLA who will assess his fitness to drive.",
