      question: "What is a central vestibular disorder?",
      sample_answer: "Central vestibular disorders are conditions that affect the central nervous system's processing of vestibular information, resulting in symptoms such as vertigo, dizziness, balance problems, and other sensory and motor disturbances. These disorders can arise from damage or dysfunction in the brainstem, cerebellum, or pathways connecting the vestibular organs in the inner ear to the brain. Unlike peripheral vestibular disorders, which originate in the inner ear itself, central vestibular disorders involve the parts of the brain responsible for integrating vestibular, visual, and proprioceptive inputs to maintain balance and spatial orientation.",
    },
    {
      question: "What central vestibular disorders do you know?",
      sample_answer: "Central vestibular disorders can be categorized based on the underlying cause or affected region of the central nervous system: Vascular Disorders: Including Wallenberg syndrome, known as lateral medullary syndrome, and vertebrobasilar insufficiency. Degenerative and Demyelinating Disorders such as Multiple sclerosis. Infectious and Inflammatory Disorders such as vestibular neuritis can affect the vestibular nerve, leading to vertigo and imbalance. Genetic Disorders: Episodic ataxias are inherited conditions characterized by transient episodes of ataxia and sometimes vertigo. Neoplastic Disorders: Tumors of the posterior fossa, such as acoustic neuroma or meningioma, can present with vertigo. Functional Disorders: These include migraine-associated vertigo or vestibular migraine, and migraine with brainstem aura (MBA), where vestibular symptoms are associated with migraine.",

      question: "What are the diagnostic criteria for vestibular migraine?",
      sample_answer: "The diagnostic criteria for vestibular migraine jointly developed by the Bárány Society and the International Classification of Headache Disorders include: At least five episodes of vestibular symptoms of moderate or severe intensity, lasting between 5 minutes and 72 hours. Current or past history of migraine with or without aura according to the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD) criteria. One or more migrainous features (such as headache, photophobia, phonophobia, or visual aura) present with at least 50% of the vestibular episodes. Symptoms not better accounted for by another vestibular or headache disorder.",
    },
    {
      question: "What are the diagnostic criteria for migraine with brainstem aura?",
      sample_answer: "The ICHD-3 criteria for migraine with brainstem aura include: At least two attacks fulfilling the criteria for migraine with aura. Aura consisting of at least two of the following fully reversible brainstem symptoms: dysarthria, vertigo, tinnitus, hypacusis, diplopia, ataxia, or decreased level of consciousness. No motor or retinal symptoms. Symptoms not better accounted for by another ICHD-3 diagnosis or other neurological disorder.",
    },
    {
      question: "How does Wallenberg syndrome present?",
      sample_answer: "Wallenberg syndrome, or lateral medullary syndrome, presents with a constellation of symptoms categorized by: Sensory Symptoms: Ipsilateral loss of facial sensation and contralateral loss of pain and temperature sensation in the body. Vestibular Symptoms: Vertigo, nystagmus, nausea, and vomiting. Ocular Symptoms: Diplopia due to cranial nerve involvement. Autonomic Symptoms: Ipsilateral Horners syndrome (ptosis, miosis, anhydrosis). Swallowing and Speech Difficulties: Dysphagia and dysarthria from involvement of the lower cranial nerves.",

    {
      question: "What are key history and examination findings to elicit in a patient you suspect to have a central vestibular disorder?",
      sample_answer: "In patients suspected of having a central vestibular disorder, key history findings include: Episodes of vertigo or dizziness and their duration and frequency. Associated symptoms such as headaches, visual disturbances (aura), hearing loss, or tinnitus. Family history of similar symptoms or known genetic disorders. Triggers for symptoms (e.g., stress, specific movements, dietary triggers). Key examination findings include: Nystagmus with specific characteristics (e.g., direction, positional dependency). Neurological examination focusing on cranial nerves, coordination, and sensory testing. Gait and balance assessment, possibly showing ataxia or falls towards the lesion side. Audiometric evaluation for patients with hearing symptoms.",
    },
    {
      question: "Which diagnostic tests are essential in evaluating a patient suspected of having a central vestibular disorder and what findings would you expect?",
      sample_answer: "Essential diagnostic tests for suspected central vestibular disorder include: MRI of the Brain: To identify lesions within the central nervous system that could be causing symptoms. Findings might include infarcts, demyelinating plaques, or tumors. Audiometry: In cases where hearing loss or tinnitus is present, to evaluate for cochlear or auditory nerve involvement. Vestibular Testing: Including VNG (Videonystagmography) or calorics to assess vestibular function. Findings may show abnormal vestibulo-ocular reflexes suggestive of central involvement. Blood Tests: To identify possible inflammatory, infectious, or metabolic causes. Genetic Testing: For suspected hereditary conditions like episodic ataxia.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can you explain the pathophysiology underlying vestibular migraine and how it differs from migraine with brainstem aura?",
      sample_answer: "Vestibular migraine is believed to involve abnormal activation and sensitization of the trigeminovascular system, leading to a release of neuropeptides that affect both the vestibular and pain pathways. The pathophysiology may also involve cortical spreading depression affecting areas of the brain responsible for processing vestibular information. Migraine with brainstem aura (MBA), formerly known as basilar-type migraine, involves reversible dysfunction of the brainstem and/or bilateral occipital cortex, leading to a broader spectrum of symptoms including vertigo, ataxia, and decreased level of consciousness. Unlike vestibular migraine, MBA involves at least two brainstem symptoms and excludes motor weakness, distinguishing it from hemiplegic migraine.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do you treat a patient with vestibular migraines?",
      sample_answer: "Treatment of vestibular migraine involves both acute management and preventive strategies: Acute Symptom Management: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen (400-600 mg) or naproxen (250-500 mg) can be used. Triptans, such as sumatriptan (25-100 mg orally or 6 mg subcutaneously), may also be effective for associated headaches. Preventive Medication: Beta-blockers: Propranolol (starting at 40 mg/day, titrated up to 160 mg/day) or metoprolol (starting at 25 mg/day, titrated up to 200 mg/day). Anticonvulsants: Topiramate (start at 25 mg/day, titrating up to 100 mg/day) or valproate (start with 250 mg/day, up to a maximum of 1500 mg/day). Antidepressants: Amitriptyline (starting dose of 10 mg at bedtime, titrated up to 50 mg/day) can be useful, particularly if comorbid depression or anxiety is present. Lifestyle Modifications: Regular sleep patterns, avoidance of known migraine triggers (such as certain foods, stress, and dehydration), and regular physical activity are recommended.",

      question: "How do you treat a patient with migraine with brainstem aura?",
      sample_answer: "The treatment for MBA is similar to that for other forms of migraine with aura, focusing on prevention and acute management: Acute Symptom Management: NSAIDs such as ibuprofen (400-600 mg) and antiemetics for nausea are commonly used. The use of triptans in MBA is controversial due to theoretical concerns about vasoconstriction. Preventive Medication: Calcium Channel Blockers: Verapamil is commonly used (starting at 120 mg/day, titrated up according to response and tolerance, up to 240 mg/day). Antiseizure Medications: Topiramate (start at 25 mg/day, titrating up to 100 mg/day) or lamotrigine (starting at 25 mg/day, titrated up to 100-200 mg/day) may be effective. Lifestyle Modifications: Identifying and avoiding triggers, maintaining a regular sleep schedule, and engaging in regular physical activity can help manage MBA.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do comorbid conditions, such as anxiety or depression, affect the management of vestibular migraine or migraine with brainstem aura?",
      sample_answer: "Comorbid conditions like anxiety or depression are common in patients with vestibular migraine or MBA and can complicate management. These conditions may amplify symptoms, reduce treatment adherence, and impact the overall quality of life. Management should include: Integrated Care: Addressing mental health alongside vestibular symptoms with a multidisciplinary approach. Psychotherapy: Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) may help patients cope with symptoms and reduce stress-related triggers. Pharmacotherapy: Careful selection of medications that can address both the vestibular symptoms and psychiatric comorbidities. SSRIs or SNRIs may be beneficial for both mood disorders and migraine prophylaxis. Lifestyle Interventions: Stress management techniques, regular exercise, and relaxation techniques can be beneficial.",
